CASE: BL-14-K30690
PATIENT: STEVEN KEATING
Pathologist:
Lynette M Sholl, M.D.
CLINICAL DATA:
Clinical History: None given.
Clinical Diagnosis: Astrocytoma
DNA was isolated from a brain tumor biopsy, BS14-41488-B2. DNA methylation
patterns in the CPG island of the MGMT gene (Genbank accession number AL355531
nt46931-47011) was determined by chemical (bisulfite) modification of
unmethylated, but not methylated, cytosines to uracil and subsequent PCR using
primers specific for either methylated or the modified unmethylated DNA
(Esteller et al. Cancer Res. 1999; 59:793-797.) The PCR products were analyzed
in duplicate parallel runs by capillary gel electrophoresis. The sensitivity of
the assay based on DNA dilutions studies is at least 1:1000.
RESULT:
The analyzed region of the MGMT promoter is partially METHYLATED (1 of 2
aliquots).
INTERPRETATION:
MGMT (06-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair gene. Methylation
of the promotor leads to gene silencing and loss of MGMT expression. A recent
study that tested the methylation status of the same region of the MGMT
promoter in glioblastomas found that MGMT promoter methylation was an
independent favorable prognostic factor and was associated with a survival
benefit in patients treated with temozolamide and radiotherapy. (Hegi M,
Diserans A, Gorlia T et al. MGMT Gene Silencing and Benefit from Temozolomide
in Glioblastoma. N Engl J Med 2005; 352:997-1003.)
These tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by
the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital. They have
not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA
has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.

********** Addended Report *
Resident: David Meredith, M.D., Ph.D.
Pathologist: Umberto De Girolami, M.D.
PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:
A-D. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED "LEFT FRONTAL TUMOR" (FSA, SMA) :
NEWLY DIAGNOSED TUMOR (Surgery #1)
DIFFUSE ASTROCYTOMA, W.H.O. Grade 2 (ICD-0 9400/3)
IDH1 (R132H) MUTATION POSITIVE (by IHC)
TP53 PROTEIN
POSITIVE (by IHC, suggestive of mutation)
BRAF (V600E)
NOT DETECTED (by IHC)
NOTE:
There is evidence that the tumor may lie at the higher end of the grade 2
spectrum with focal regions having slightly higher than average cellularity and
atypia. Mitotic activity was detected in block B1, but this region was very
small (only a few high power fields) and mitoses were not detected in other
regions of the tumor. The proliferation rate in the region with mitotic
activity and the vast majority of the tumor was low (not exceeding 4%).
Therefore while grading as WHO Grade 3 was considered it was not felt to be
warranted at this time given the overall findings in a well sampled tumor.
Classification of the tumor as MIXED GLIOMA, WHO GRADE 2 would also be
appropriate given that reliable criteria for distinction of diffuse astrocytoma
and mixed glioma have not been established and the clinical significance of
distinguishing between these two entities is not clear.
The overall size of the resection is very large.
The tumor infiltrates adjacent brain parenchyma.
W.H.O. Histologic Grading Criteria
Cellularity:
moderate
Atypia:
moderate
Mitoses:
present (but small focal region only)
Vascular Proliferation: not present
Necrosis:
not present

SOLID TUMOR ARRAY CGH ANALYSIS
RESULT:
arr [hg19]
3426.31q28 (171,681,429-188,500,069) x3,7p22.3426.2 (42,976-155,143,600) x3, (8) x3
INTERPRETATION:
Several copy number changes were identified following array comparative genomic
hybridization (aCGH) of this formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary
brain tumor specimen. The following genomic imbalances were noted:
ised, parating ambedde amparative geno
(1) a 16.8 Mb single copy gain of 3q, which includes PIK3CA and sox2,
(2) polysomy 7
(3) polysomy 8
The findings are CONSISTENT the histopathologic diagnosis of a DIFFUSE
ASTROCYTOMA WHO GRADE 2 or other low grade IDH-mutated astrocytoma/mixed
glioma.
Gains involving Chr 7 and 8 are common in diffuse astrocytoma. In isolation
however, they are not specific or diagnostic of low grade glioma or any other
tumor type.
Aberrations commonly correlated with less favorable outcomes in diffuse
astrocytoma (PTEN/10q loss, CDKN2A/9q loss, etc) are NOT DETECTED.
The findings are NOT CONSISTENT with an oligodendroglioma as there is no
evidence for 1p/19g co-deletion.
See Table 1 (below) for a list of selected genes/regions that were evaluated
specifically for this interpretation.
COMMENTS:
Array - based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was performed using the
stock 1x1M Agilent SurePrint G3 Human CGH Microarray chip to identify tumor -
specific genomic copy number changes. Genomic DNA isolated from the FFPE
specimen submitted was hybridized with genomic DNA isolated from a reference
DNA sample representing a pool of karyotypically normal individuals (Promega,
Madison, WI). The array platform contains 963,029 probes spaced across the
human genome with a 2.1 kb overall median probe spacing and a 1.8 kb probe

spacing in RefSeq genes. A genomic imbalance is reported when a minimum of
eight (8) consecutive probes, which correspond to approximately 14-16 kb, show
an average log2 ratio above +0.18 or below -0.30. Amplifications are reported
when an average log2 ratio for a given interval is equal to, or greater than,
+2.0.
This assay cannot exclude: (1) chromosome imbalances when the proportion of
tumor cells in the original sample is less than 50%; (2) chromosome imbalances
smaller than the resolution of the chip, or (3) tumor heterogeneity,
particularly if an abnormal clone is not sufficiently represented in the
original sample. This assay is not designed to identify balanced chromosomal
rearrangements (e.g., balanced reciprocal translocations, inversions or
insertions), ploidy changes, uniparental disomy or DNA methylation. The
composition of this array is based on the UCSC hg19 (GRCh 37), Feb. 2009
(http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway). This test was developed and its
performance determined by the BWH Cytogenetics Laboratory as required by the
CLIA '88 regulations. This test is used for clinical purposes.
