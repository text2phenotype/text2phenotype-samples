				<p><b>REASON FOR CONSULTATION: </b> Clogged AV shunt.</p>
<p><b>HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:</b>  This is a 32-year-old African-American male who came to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient complains of fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever.  The patient states that the shunt was placed in February, although according to medical records it was placed in April and it has been periodically clogging since its placement.  The patient had dialysis today, which is Saturday, for approximately one hour before the shunt no longer worked.  The patient had been seen in the Emergency Room yesterday, 08/29/03, by Dr. X for the same problem.  At that time, Dr. X felt that the patient should use the AV fistula during dialysis and after the fistula is able to be used, the PermCath on the right subclavian should be removed.  As mentioned above, he had dialysis today and they were unable to use AV fistula as well as the PermCath read &quot;did not work&quot;.  The patient has had dialysis since January secondary to hypertension-induced renal failure.  He takes dialysis Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at the ABCD Dialysis Center.  He also was seen at XYZ and he had an apparent thrombectomy with reversal done a few days ago.  The patient&#8217;s history at this point is a little sketchy; however, he states that he left AMA.  All other systems are reviewed and are negative.</p>
