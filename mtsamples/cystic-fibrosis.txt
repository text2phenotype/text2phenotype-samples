<p><b>CHART REVIEW: </b> This chart was thoroughly reviewed prior to this conference by X, RN, BSN.  Review of chart indicates that mother has good adherence to treatment plan indicated by medications being refilled in a timely fashion as well as clinic contact documented with appropriate concerns.</p>
<p><b>DISCUSSION:  PHYSICIAN: </b> X did note that mother reported that the patient had discontinued the Pulmozyme due to CCS reasons.  He is not sure what this would be since CCS Pulmozyme is a covered benefit on CCS for children with cystic fibrosis.  This situation will be looked into with the hope of restarting soon.  Other than that the patient seems to be doing well.  A flu shot was given.</p>
<p><b>NURSE: </b> X, RN, BSN, did note that the patient was doing quite well.  Reinforcement of current medication regime was supplied.  No other needs identified at this time.</p>
<p><b>RESPIRATORY CARE: </b> X, RCP, did review appropriate sequencing of medications with the patient and family.  Once again, she was concerned the lack of Pulmozyme due to mom stating CCS issues.  At this time, they have increased the Vest use to twice daily and are doing 30-minute treatments.</p>
<p><b>DIETICIAN: </b> X, RD, CDE, notes that the patient is 89% of his ideal body weight, which is a nutritional failure per cystic fibrosis guidelines.  This is despite the fact that he has an excellent appetite.  Mom reports he is taking his enzymes consistently as well as vitamins.  He does have problems meeting his goal for resource drinks per day.  Since the patient has been struggling to gain weight this past year, we will need to monitor his nutritional status and weight trend very closely.  A variety of additional high calorie items were discussed with mom.</p>
<p><b>SOCIAL WORK: </b> X, LCSW, notes that mom has recently gradually from respiratory therapy school and has accepted a position here at Children&#8217;s Hospital.  The patient is doing well in school.  With the exception of issues with CCS authorization, there appears to be no pressing social needs at this time.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION: </b> <br />1.  Cystic fibrosis.<br />2.  Poor nutritional status.</p>
<p><b>PLAN:  </b><br />1.  Give flu vaccine 0.5 mg IM now, this was done.<br />2.  Continue all other medications and treatment.<br />3.  Evaluate/investigate rationale for no authorization of Pulmozyme with CCS.<br />4.  Needs to augment current high-calorie diet to give more nutrition.  To follow advice by a dietician.<br />5.  Continue all the medication treatments before.<br />6.  To continue off and ongoing psychosocial nutritional counseling as necessary.</p>
