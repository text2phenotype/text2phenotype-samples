				<p><b>DIAGNOSIS: </b> Left sciatica.</p>
<p><b>ANESTHESIA: </b> Intravenous sedation</p>
<p><b>NAME OF OPERATION:</b><br />1.  Left L5-S1 transforaminal epidural steroid block with fluoroscopy.<br />2.  Left L4-5 transforaminal epidural steroid block with fluoroscopy.<br />3.  Monitored intravenous Versed sedation.</p>
<p><b>PROCEDURE: </b> The patient was taken to the block room.  He was placed prone on the fluoroscopy table.  He was monitored appropriately.  He was administered Versed 2 mg IV.  His O2 saturation remained greater than 90%.  His back was prepped and draped.  The C-arm was brought in.  The endplates at L5-S1 were squared off.  The C-arm was rotated to the left.  The L5 pedicle, the superior articular process of the L5-S1 facet, and the &quot;neck of the scotty dog&quot; were all visualized.  After adequate local anesthesia, a 22-gauge, 3-1/2-inch spinal needle was inserted using down-the-barrel-of-the-needle technique.  The needle was advanced into the posterior aspect of the foramen and then advanced anteriorly toward the 6 o&#8217;clock position on the pedicle.  No paresthesias were noted.  One-half cc of contrast was injected and spread medially around the pedicle and into the epidural space, and the L5 nerve root was visualized.  Depo-Medrol 80 mg plus 1 cc of 4% preservative-free lidocaine was injected.  The needle was flushed and removed.</p>
<p>I then went up to the L4-5 level, and using a similar technique, injected the patient transforaminally at the L4-5 level.  Depo-Medrol 80 mg plus 1 cc of 4% preservative-free lidocaine was injected at the L4-5 level just as at the L5-S1 level.  The patient had pain down his left leg during the injection, primarily at the L5-S1 level similar to what he normally experiences.  He was awake and alert, and taken to the recovery room in good condition.  His left leg pain was relieved.</p>
