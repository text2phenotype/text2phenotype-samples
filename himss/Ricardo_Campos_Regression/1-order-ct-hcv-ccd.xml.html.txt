Indications for Procedure
HCV infection, suspected hepatic fibrosis.
History
History: Liver Cirrhosis

Findings
Finding: The basic study documents significant alterations in hepatic morphology, visualizing substantial nodularity of the lower surface of the liver, moderate nodularity of the upper liver surface, and generalized heterogeneity of the hepatic parenchyma. The porta hepatis and interlobar fissures are widened due to shrinkage of both the right lobe and the medial segment of the left lobe with concomitant enlargement of the caudate lobe and the lateral segment of the left lobe. These changes are consistent with extensive hepatic fibrosis.

Impressions
Impression: A contrast enhanced computed tomography portal phase image confirms the irregular surface of the liver and heterogeneous enhancement of parenchyma with a reticular pattern that also suggests confluent fibrosis consistent with chronic Hepatitis C infection. .
