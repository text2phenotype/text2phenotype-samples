				<p><b>PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:</b>  Macular edema, right eye.</p>
<p><b>POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  </b>Macular edema, right eye.</p>
<p><b>TITLE OF OPERATION: </b> Insertion of radioactive plaque, right eye with lateral canthotomy.</p>
<p><b>OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  </b>The patient was prepped and draped in the usual manner for a local eye procedure.  Initially, a 5 cc retrobulbar injection of 2% Xylocaine was done.  Then, a lid speculum was inserted and the conjunctiva was incised 4 mm posterior to the limbus.  A 2-0 silk traction suture was placed around the insertion of the lateral rectus muscle and, with gentle traction, the temporal one-half of the globe was exposed.  The plaque was positioned on the scleral surface immediately behind the macula and secured with two sutures of 5-0 Dacron.  The placement was confirmed with indirect ophthalmoscopy.  Next, the eye was irrigated with Neosporin and the conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain catgut.  The intraocular pressure was found to be within normal limits.  An eye patch was applied and the patient was sent to the Recovery Room in good condition.  A lateral canthotomy had been done.</p>
