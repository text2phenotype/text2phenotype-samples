<p><b>PLAN: </b> Diagnosis of a rotator cuff tendinitis and shoulder impingement were discussed.  I noted that this is a very common condition resulting in significant difficulties with use of the arm.  Several treatment options and their potential benefits were described.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories can be helpful but typically are slow acting.  Cortisone shots can be very effective and are quite safe.  Often more than one injection may be required.  Physical therapy can also be helpful, particularly if there is any loss of shoulder mobility or strength.  If these treatments fail to resolve symptoms, an MRI or shoulder arthrogram may be required to rule out a rotator cuff tear.  Injected shoulder joint and with Celestone Soluspan 1.0 cc .
