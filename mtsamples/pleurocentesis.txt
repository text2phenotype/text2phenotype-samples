<p><b>POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: </b> Right pleural effusion with respiratory failure and dyspnea.</p>
<p><b>PROCEDURE: </b> Ultrasound-guided right pleurocentesis.</p>
<p><b>ANESTHESIA: </b> Local with lidocaine.</p>
<p><b>TECHNIQUE IN DETAIL: </b> After informed consent was obtained from the patient and his mother, the chest was scanned with portable ultrasound.  Findings revealed a normal right hemidiaphragm, a moderate right pleural effusion without septation or debris, and no gliding sign of the lung on the right.  Using sterile technique and with ultrasound as a guide, a pleural catheter was inserted and serosanguinous fluid was withdrawn, a total of 1 L.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Portable x-ray is pending.</p>
