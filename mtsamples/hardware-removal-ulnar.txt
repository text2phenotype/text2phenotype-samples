<p><b>HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  </b>The patient is a 5-year, 5-month-old male who sustained a both-bone forearm fracture in September 2007.  The fracture healed uneventfully, but then the patient subsequently suffered a refracture one month ago.  The patient had shortening in arms, noted in both bones.  The parents opted for surgical stabilization with nailing.  This was performed one month ago on return visit.  His ulnar nail was quite prominent underneath the skin.  It was decided to remove the ulnar nail early and place the patient in another cast for 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with the mother.  Risk of surgery incudes risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation in most of the extremity, need for longer casting.  All questions were answered and mother agreed to above plan.</p>
