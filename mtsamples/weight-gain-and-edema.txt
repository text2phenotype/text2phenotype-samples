Hypothyroidism is secondary to radioactive iodine for Graves disease many years ago.  She is clinically and biochemically euthyroid.  Her TSH is mildly suppressed, but her free T4 is normal and with her weight gain I will not decrease her dose of levothyroxine.  I will continue on 300 mcg daily of Synthroid.  If she wanted to lose significant weight, I shall repeat thyroid function test in six weeks&#8217; time to ensure that she is not hyperthyroid.</p>
