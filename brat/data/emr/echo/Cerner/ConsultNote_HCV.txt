Assessment/Plan:
1. Hepatitis C
This is a 48-year-old male patient here with history of chronic hepatitis C. He has co-infection with genotype 1B and
genotype 2. In order to effectively target both of these genotypes, we will need to treat with Epclusa. He does have
some concerning findings with his laboratory studies including significant transaminitis, elevated AFP tumor marker, and
low range normal platelets.
I reviewed that his labs show he does have immunity against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.
We will continue to trend his AFP tumor marker throughout treatment.

Discussed he should avoid acid suppressive therapies while taking Epclusa.
Education was provided about risks and benefits of treatment for HCV. Side effects typically are mild, including
headache, fatigue, insomnia, possible stomach upset. Advised to avoid acid suppressive therapy. Stressed importance of
compliance with medication, and educated that missed doses raise the risk of treatment failure.
Discussed benefits of treatment, including reduction of advancement of liver disease, progression to liver failure, and
liver cancer.
The patient will be managed in consultation with the UNM Project ECHO and with treatment guidance from Dr. Sanjeev
Arora (Hepatology) and Dr. Karla Thornton (Infectious Disease). Treatment will be planned using the latest guidelines
from the American Association of Liver Disease (AASLD).
Discussed with the patient barriers of insurance coverage for therapies and to allow appropriate time for completion of
the prior authorization process.
2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hemoglobin Alc goal of less than 7.0%
Discussed that treatment of chronic hepatitis C can benefit glucose control.
We will complete a point of care hemoglobin Alc to document his current status of glucose control. He had just seen his
PCP on 8/14/2017 regarding his diabetes and reference was made to updating his labs, but this had not been completed
yet. We collected a POC Alc in clinic = 14.0.
3. Hypovitaminosis D
I prescribed a prescription vitamin D to help improve this deficiency. This may benefit his fatigue as well as help
decrease the rate of his liver fibrosis.
4. Severe obesity (BMI 35.0-39.9)
Discussed that his increased echogenicity and enlarged liver is likely related to fatty liver disease and this could still
worsen his liver status and result in liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
