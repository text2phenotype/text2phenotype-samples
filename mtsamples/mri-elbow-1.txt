				<p>This is a middle-aged female complaining of elbow pain.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS:</b><br />There is severe tendinitis of the common extensor tendon origin with diffuse intratendinous inflammation (coronal T2 image #1452, sagittal T2 image #1672). There is irregularity of the deep surface of the tendon consistent with mild fraying (#1422 and 1484) however there is no distinct tear.</p>
<p>There is a joint effusion of the radiocapitellar articulation with mild fluid distention.</p>
<p>The radial collateral (proper) ligament remains intact. There is periligamentous inflammation of the lateral ulnar collateral ligament (coronal T2 image #1484) of the radial collateral ligamentous complex. There is no articular erosion or osteochondral defect with no intra-articular loose body.</p>
<p>There is minimal inflammation of the subcutis adipose space extending along the origin of the common flexor tendon (axial T2 image #1324). The common flexor tendon otherwise is normal.</p>
<p>There is minimal periligamentous inflammation of the anterior band of the ulnar collateral ligament (coronal T2 image #1516, axial T2 image #1452) with an intrinsically normal ligament.</p>
<p>The ulnotrochlear articulation is normal.</p>
<p>The brachialis and biceps tendons are normal with a normal triceps tendon. The anterior, posterior, medial and lateral muscular compartments are normal.</p>
<p>The radial, median and ulnar nerves are normal with no apparent ulnar neuritis.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION:</b><br />Lateral epicondylitis with severe tendinitis of the common extensor tendon origin and minimal deep surface fraying, without a discrete tendon tear.</p>
<p>Periligamentous inflammation of the radial collateral ligamentous complex as described above with intrinsically normal ligaments.</p>
<p>Small joint effusion of the radiocapitellar articulation with no osteochondral defect or intra-articular loose body.</p>
<p>Mild peritendinous inflammation of the subcutis adipose space adjacent to the common flexor tendon origin with an intrinsically normal tendon.</p>
<p>Minimal periligamentous inflammation of the anterior band of the ulnar collateral ligament with an intrinsically normal ligament.</p>
