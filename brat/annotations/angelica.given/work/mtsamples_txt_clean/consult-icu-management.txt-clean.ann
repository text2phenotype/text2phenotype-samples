HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 43-year-old gentleman who
presented from an outside hospital with complaints of right upper quadrant
pain in the abdomen, which revealed possible portal vein and superior
mesenteric vein thrombus leading to mesenteric ischemia. The patient was
transferred to the ABCD Hospital where he had a weeklong course with
progressive improvement in his status after aggressive care including
intubation, fluid resuscitation, and watchful waiting. The patient clinically
improved; however, his white count remained elevated with the intermittent
fevers prompting a CT scan. Repeat CT scan showed a loculated area of ischemic
bowel with perforation in the left upper abdomen. The patient was taken
emergently to the operating room last night by the General Surgery Service
where proximal half of the jejunum was noted to be liquified with 3
perforations. This section of small bowel was resected, and a wound VAC placed
for damage control. Plan was to return the patient to the Operating Room
tomorrow for further exploration and possible re-anastomosis of the bowel. The
patient is currently intubated, sedated, and on pressors for septic shock and
in the down ICU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Prior to coming into the hospital for this current
episode, the patient had hypertension, diabetes, and GERD.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Included a cardiac cath with no interventions
taken.
