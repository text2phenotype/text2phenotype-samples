				<p><b>REASON FOR EXAM:</b>  CVA.</p>
<p><b>INDICATIONS: </b> CVA.</p>
<p>This is technically acceptable.  There is some limitation related to body habitus.</p>
<p><b>DIMENSIONS:  </b>The interventricular septum 1.2, posterior wall 10.9, left ventricular end-diastolic 5.5, and end-systolic 4.5, the left atrium 3.9.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS: </b> The left atrium was mildly dilated.  No masses or thrombi were seen.  The left ventricle showed borderline left ventricular hypertrophy with normal wall motion and wall thickening, EF of 60%.  The right atrium and right ventricle are normal in size.</p>
<p>Mitral valve showed mitral annular calcification in the posterior aspect of the valve.  The valve itself was structurally normal.  No vegetations seen.  No significant MR. Mitral inflow pattern was consistent with diastolic dysfunction grade 1.  The aortic valve showed minimal thickening with good exposure and coaptation.  Peak velocity is normal.  No AI.</p>
<p>Pulmonic and tricuspid valves were both structurally normal.</p>
<p>Interatrial septum was appeared to be intact in the views obtained.  A bubble study was not performed.</p>
<p>No pericardial effusion was seen.  Aortic arch was not assessed.</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br />1.  Borderline left ventricular hypertrophy with normal ejection fraction at 60%.<br />2.  Mitral annular calcification with structurally normal mitral valve.<br />3.  No intracavitary thrombi is seen.<br />4.  Interatrial septum was somewhat difficult to assess, but appeared to be intact on the views obtained.</p>
