<p><b>ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:</b>  We will continue present therapy except we will add Tylenol No.  3 to take 1 tablet before bed as needed for her back pain.  If she does develop drowsiness from this, then the CNS side effects will help her sleep.  During the day, her daughter likes the patient to remain alert and will use the ibuprofen at that time as long as she does not develop any GI symptoms.  We will make sure that she is taking the ibuprofen with food.  No further laboratory tests will be done at this time.</p>
