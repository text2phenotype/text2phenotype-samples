                                  KRAS encodes a member of the RAS family of small GTPases that mediate transduction of growth
       KRAS                       signals. Activation of RAS signaling promotes cell growth, differentiation, and survival by activating the
       G12R                       RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K, and other pathways1. KRAS is one of the most commonly mutated genes in human
                                  malignancies, with particularly high incidences in pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancers2,3,4. KRAS
                                  missense mutations affecting amino acids G12, G13, A59, Q61, and A146 of the KRAS protein have been
                                  characterized to be activating and oncogenic1,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15. KRAS mutations have been reported in
                                  70% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (COSMIC, Oct 2014). In the pancreatic adenocarcinoma
                                  TCGA dataset, KRAS mutations have been found in 63% of cases (cBioPortal, Oct 2014). In the literature,
                                  activating KRAS mutation has been reported in more than 80% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas, with the
                                  majority of mutations found at codon 123,16,17,18. KRAS mutations, particularly G12D, have been
                                  associated with decreased median survival time in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma16.
                                  Constitutive activation of KRAS activates the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, leading to tumorigenesis1,19, and
                                  may therefore predict sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway. MEK inhibitors, alone or in combination with
                                  other targeted therapies, are in clinical trials in solid tumors, including tumors with KRAS mutations20. The
                                  MEK inhibitor trametinib is FDA approved as both a single agent and in combination with dabrafenib for
                                  the treatment of melanoma and is being studied in clinical trials in solid tumors21. A preclinical study
                                  reported that pancreatic cancer cell lines with the KRAS G12V mutation specifically are much more
                                  resistant to MEK inhibitors than cells with wild type KRAS or other KRAS mutations22. Other preclinical
                                  studies have suggested that antitumorigenic effects of MEK inhibitors in models of pancreatic cancer are
                                  significantly improved by combination with PI3K-Akt pathway inhibitors, CDK4/6 inhibitors, or anti-EGFR
                                  and anti-HER2 antibodies; the synergistic effects were observed in both KRAS mutant and KRAS wild
                                  type tumors23,24,25,26. The reovirus Reolysin targets cells with activated RAS signaling27,28,29 and is in
                                  clinical trials in some tumor types. Reolysin has demonstrated mixed clinical efficacy, with the highest rate
                                  of response reported for head and neck cancer30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38. KRAS mutation status may predict lack
                                  of response to EGFR-targeted therapies such as erlotinib, gefitinib, cetuximab, and panitumumab in non-
                                  small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colon cancer39,40,41,42,43. However, a retrospective analysis of a Phase
                                  3 study examining pancreatic cancer patients treated with erlotinib and chemotherapy found that KRAS
                                  mutation was not associated with objective response but was significantly associated with decreased
                                  overall survival44.


                                  NTRK1 encodes the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkA, which plays a role in the development of the nervous
       NTRK1                      system by regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neurons. TrkA is activated upon
       A5T                        binding of its ligand NGF to promote several downstream signaling pathways, including the GRB2-Ras-
                                  MAPK and NF-KappaB pathways45,46,47,48. The NTRK1 mutation observed here has not been
                                  characterized and its effect on TrkA function is unknown. However, this mutation has been observed in
                                  the context of cancer before, which may indicate biological relevance. NTRK1 mutations have been
                                  reported in 0.4-2% of pancreatic carcinomas (COSMIC, cBioPortal, Nov 2014). TrkA has been shown to
                                  be expressed in pancreatic carcinoma patients, and TrkA expression is correlated with aggressive
                                  disease, poor prognosis, pain, and perineural invasion49,50. TrkA expression and activity in pancreatic
                                  cancer cell lines was reported to be correlated with resistance to gemcitabine, and NTRK1 knockdown
                                  sensitized the cells to gemcitabine treatment51. NTRK1 expression was shown to promote the proliferation
                                  of pancreatic cancer cells, which could be reduced by ERK inhibitors and 2-deoxy-D-glucose52. There are
                                  currently no approved therapies targeting NTRK1. Pan-Trk inhibitors, including lestaurtinib (CEP-701) and
                                  AZD7451, have been evaluated in clinical trials in several tumor types, and additional studies are in
                                  progress in certain cancers53,54,55. Crizotinib, a TKI approved for NSCLC, has been reported to be
                                  effective in NSCLC cells with activating fusions in NTRK156. However, as the mutation reported here has
                                  not been functionally characterized, it is not known whether this therapeutic approach would be relevant.


                                  Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in
                                  aggressive advanced cancers57. TP53 missense mutations located within the DNA-binding domain (DBD;

       TP53                       transactivation of p53-dependent genes and are predicted to promote tumorigenesis58,59. TP53 mutations
       R175H                      have been found in approximately 25-65% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas, including 48.6% of pancreas
                                  ductal carcinoma cases (COSMIC, cBioPortal, Feb 2015). TP53 mutations are common in pancreatic
                                  ductal adenocarcinoma and occur in the process of pancreatic carcinogenesis60,61. Studies have found
                                  inconsistent results regarding the prognostic significance of p53 expression in pancreatic ductal
                                  adenocarcinoma62,63. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare disorder Li-Fraumeni
                                  syndrome and the early onset of many cancers64,65. Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53
                                  mutations in the general population range from 1:5,00066 to 1:20,00067, and in the appropriate clinical
                                  context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. There are no approved therapies to address TP53
                                  mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the Wee-1
                                  inhibitor MK-177568,69, therapies that reactivate mutant p53 such as APR-24670, or p53 gene therapy and
                                  immunotherapeutics such as ALT-801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). Clinical trials of
                                  these agents are under way for some tumor types for patients with a TP53 mutation. Kevetrin has also
                                  been reported to activate p53 in preclinical studies and might be relevant in the context of mutant p53

       G365fs*19                  that result in loss of the MH1 domain (aa 18-142), MH2 domain (aa 323-552), or SAD domain (aa 275-
                                  320), such as observed here, are predicted to result in a loss of function73. SMAD4 mutations have been
                                  reported in 17% of pancreatic ductal carcinomas (COSMIC, Oct 2014). Homozygous loss of SMAD4
                                  occurs in up to 55% of pancreatic tumors through a combination of loss of heterozygosity and gene
                                  mutation74. In one study, SMAD4 mutations were reported in 32% of pancreatic cancers and the presence
                                  of a mutation predicted poorer survival75. Loss of Smad4 protein expression has been reported in 32-60%
                                  of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma samples63,76. SMAD4 alteration, by mutation or homozygous
                                  deletion, as well as loss of Smad4 protein expression, has been found to be associated with poor
                                  prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients63,75,77. Germline mutations of SMAD4 are
                                  commonly seen in juvenile polyposis syndrome, which is associated with an increased risk of
                                  gastrointestinal cancers78. At present, there are no therapies available to address SMAD4 loss or mutation
                                  in cancer. Some studies suggest that pancreatic tumors with low Smad4 expression exhibit increased
                                  responsiveness to chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin and irinotecan79,80.

   THERAPY                           SUMMARY OF DATA IN OTHER TUMOR TYPE
   Trametinib                        Trametinib is a MEK inhibitor that is FDA approved as both a single agent and in combination with
                                     dabrafenib for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K
                                     mutations. Activating KRAS mutations may activate the MAPK pathway and predict sensitivity to inhibitors
                                     such as trametinib. A Phase 1b trial of trametinib in combination with gemcitabine in patients with solid
                                     tumors showed a complete response in a breast cancer patient, as well as partial responses in pancreatic
                                     and salivary gland cancers. In particular, 3 of 10 patients with measurable pancreatic cancer exhibited
                                     partial responses81. However, in a Phase 2 study of 160 pancreatic cancer patients, the combination of
                                     trametinib with gemcitabine did not result in significant improvement in overall survival (OS), progression-
                                     free survival (PFS), or response rate (RR) compared with gemcitabine alone82; KRAS mutation status
                                     was not associated with overall survival in this study. Furthermore, a Phase 2 study of combination
                                     treatment with gemcitabine and refametinib (another MEK inhibitor) in pancreatic cancer reported a trend
                                     toward a higher RR (48% vs. 28%), longer PFS (9.0 months vs. 4.6 months) and longer OS (18.2 months
                                     vs. 6.6 months) in KRAS-wildtype patients compared to KRAS-mutant patients (Riess et al., 2014; ASCO
                                     Abstract 4129, Van Laethem et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 4025). A Phase 2 trial of combination treatment
                                     with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib and the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib reported no responses in 41
                                     pancreatic cancer patients but stable disease (SD) in 21/41 (51%) patients, with adverse events requiring
                                     dose reduction in 38% of patients; KRAS mutation status was not assessed (Ko et al., 2013; ASCO
                                     Abstract 4014). Similarly, a Phase 1b combination trial of trametinib and the pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120
                                     showed SD in 12/24 (50%) pancreatic cancer patients, but no responses; although the study
                                     recommended a Phase 2 dose, prevalent and often severe adverse effects were reported83. However, a
                                     Phase 1b trial of a combination of trametinib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in patients with solid
                                     tumors reported frequent adverse events and the study was unable to identify a recommended Phase 2
                                     dose and schedule for the combination84.



Genomic alterations detected may be associated with activity of certain FDA approved drugs, however the agents listed in this report may have little or
no evidence in the patient's tumor type

                                   KRAS-activating mutations may result in activation of downstream pathways, including the MAPK pathway.

GENES ASSAYED IN FOUNDATIONONE
FoundationOne is designed to include all genes known to be somatically altered in human solid tumors that are validated targets for
therapy, either approved or in clinical trials, and/or that are unambiguous drivers of oncogenesis based on current knowledge. The
current assay interrogates 236 genes as well as 47 introns of 19 genes involved in rearrangements. The assay will be updated
periodically to reflect new knowledge about cancer biology.

 ABOUT FOUNDATIONONE
 FoundationOne: FoundationOne was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Foundation Medicine, Inc.
 (Foundation Medicine). FoundationOne has not been cleared or approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration
 (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. FoundationOne may be used for clinical
 purposes and should not be regarded as purely investigational or for research only. Foundation Medicine's clinical reference
 laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high-
 complexity clinical testing.
 Diagnostic Significance: FoundationOne identifies alterations to select cancer-associated genes or portions of genes
 (biomarkers). In some cases, the Test Report also highlights selected negative test results regarding biomarkers of clinical
 significance.
 Qualified Alteration Calls (Equivocal and Subclonal): An alteration denoted as "amplification ­ equivocal" implies that the
 FoundationOne assay data provide some, but not unambiguous, evidence that the copy number of a gene exceeds the threshold for
 identifying copy number amplification. The threshold used in FoundationOne for identifying a copy number amplification is five (5)
 for ERBB2 and six (6) for all other genes. Conversely, an alteration denoted as "loss ­ equivocal" implies that the FoundationOne
 assay data provide some, but not unambiguous, evidence for homozygous deletion of the gene in question. An alteration denoted
 as "subclonal" is one that the FoundationOne analytical methodology has identified as being present in <10% of the assayed tumor
 DNA.
 The Report incorporates analyses of peer-reviewed studies and other publicly available information identified by Foundation
 Medicine; these analyses and information may include associations between a molecular alteration (or lack of alteration) and one or
 more drugs with potential clinical benefit (or potential lack of clinical benefit), including drug candidates that are being studied in
 clinical research.
 NOTE: A finding of biomarker alteration does not necessarily indicate pharmacologic effectiveness (or lack thereof) of any drug or
 treatment regimen; a finding of no biomarker alteration does not necessarily indicate lack of pharmacologic effectiveness (or
 effectiveness) of any drug or treatment regimen.
 Alterations and Drugs Not Presented in Ranked Order: In this Report, neither any biomarker alteration, nor any drug associated
 with potential clinical benefit (or potential lack of clinical benefit), are ranked in order of potential or predicted efficacy.
 Level of Evidence Not Provided: Drugs with potential clinical benefit (or potential lack of clinical benefit) are not evaluated for
 source or level of published evidence.
 No Guarantee of Clinical Benefit: This Report makes no promises or guarantees that a particular drug will be effective in the
 treatment of disease in any patient. This Report also makes no promises or guarantees that a drug with potential lack of clinical
 benefit will in fact provide no clinical benefit.
 No Guarantee of Reimbursement: Foundation Medicine makes no promises or guarantees that a healthcare provider, insurer or
 other third party payor, whether private or governmental, will reimburse a patient for the cost of FoundationOne.
 Treatment Decisions are Responsibility of Physician: Drugs referenced in this Report may not be suitable for a particular
 patient. The selection of any, all or none of the drugs associated with potential clinical benefit (or potential lack of clinical benefit)
 resides entirely within the discretion of the treating physician. Indeed, the information in this Report must be considered in
 conjunction with all other relevant information regarding a particular patient, before the patient's treating physician recommends a
 course of treatment.
 Decisions on patient care and treatment must be based on the independent medical judgment of the treating physician, taking into
 consideration all applicable information concerning the patient's condition, such as patient and family history, physical examinations,
 information from other diagnostic tests, and patient preferences, in accordance with the standard of care in a given community. A
 treating physician's decisions should not be based on a single test, such as this Test, or the information contained in this Report.
 Certain sample or variant characteristics may result in reduced sensitivity. These include: sub clonal alterations in heterogeneous
 samples, low sample quality or with homozygous losses of <3 exons; and deletions and insertions >40bp, or in repetitive/high
 homology sequences. FoundationOne is performed using DNA derived from tumor, and as such germline events may not be
 reported. The following targets typically have low coverage resulting in a reduction in sensitivity: SDHD exon 6 and TP53 exon 1.

FoundationOne complies with all European Union (EU) requirements of the IVD Directive 98/79EC. As such, the
FoundationOne Assay has been registered for CE mark by our EU Authorized Representative, Qarad b.v.b.a, Cipalstraat 3,
2440 Geel, Belgium.
