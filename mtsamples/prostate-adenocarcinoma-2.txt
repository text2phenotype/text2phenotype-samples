				<p><b>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:</b>  This 71-year-old man went to his primary care physician for a routine physical.  His only complaints were nocturia times two and a gradual &quot;slowing down&quot; feeling.  The physical examination on 1/29 was within normal limits except for the digital rectal exam which revealed an asymmetric prostate gland with nodularity, R&gt;L.  PSA was elevated.  The differential diagnosis for the visit was abnormal prostate, suggestive of CA.</p>
<p><b>IMAGING:  </b><br />CT pelvis:  Irregular indentation of bladder.  Seminal vesicles enlarged.  Streaky densities in periprostatic fat consistent with transcapular spread to periprostatic plexus.  Impression:  prostatic malignancy with extracapsular extension and probable regional node metastasis.<br />Bone scan:  Negative for distant metastasis.</p>
<p><b>LABORATORY:</b>  PSA 32.1</p>
<p><b>PROCEDURES:</b>  Transrectal needle biopsy of prostate.  Pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical prostatectomy.</p>
<p><b>PATHOLOGY:  </b><br />Prostate biopsy:  Moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in the right lobe and poorly differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma in the left lobe of prostate.<br />Lymphadenectomy and prostatectomy:  Frozen section of removed pelvic lymph nodes demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma in one lymph node in the right obturator fossa.  Therefore, the radical prostatectomy was canceled.  <br />Final pathology diagnosis:  Pelvic lymphadenectomy; left obturator fossa, single negative lymph node.  Right obturator fossa; metastatic adenocarcinoma in 1/5 lymph nodes.  Largest involved node 1.5 cm.</p>
<p><b>TREATMENT: </b> Patient began external beam radiation therapy to the pelvis.</p>
