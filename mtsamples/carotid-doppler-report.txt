				<p>Grade I:  Intimal thickening or some atherosclerotic plaques are seen appearing to cause less than 40% obstruction.<br />Grade II:  Atherosclerotic plaques are seen which appear to be causing 40-60% obstruction.<br />Grade III:  Atherosclerotic plaques are seen which appear to be causing greater than 60% obstruction.<br />Grade IV:  The vessel is not pulsating and the artery appears to be totally obstructed with no blood flow in it.</p>
<p><b>RIGHT CAROTID SYSTEM: </b> The common carotid artery and bulb area shows mild intimal thickening with no increase in velocity and no evidence for any obstructive disease.  The internal carotid artery shows intimal thickening with some mixed plaques, but no increase in velocity and no evidence for any significant obstructive disease.  The external carotid artery shows no disease.  The vertebral was present and was antegrade.</p>
