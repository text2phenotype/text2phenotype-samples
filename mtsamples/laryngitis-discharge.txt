				<p><b>DIAGNOSIS: </b> Chronic laryngitis, hoarseness.</p>
<p><b>HISTORY:  </b>The patient is a 68-year-old male, was referred to Medical Center&#8217;s Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy secondary to voicing difficulties.  The patient attended initial evaluation plus 3 outpatient speech therapy sessions, which focused on training the patient to complete resonant voice activities and to improve his vocal hygiene.  The patient attended therapy one time a week and was given numerous home activities to do in between therapy sessions.  The patient made great progress and he came in to discuss with an appointment on 12/23/08 stating that his voice had finally returned to &quot;normal&quot;.</p>
<p><b>SHORT-TERM GOALS:</b><br />1.  To be independent with relaxation and stretching exercises and Lessac-Madsen Resonant Voice Therapy Protocol.<br />2.  He also met short-term goal therapy 3 and he is independent with resonant voice therapy tasks.<br />3.  We did not complete his __________ ratio during his last session; so, I am unsure if he had met his short-term goal number 2.<br />4.  To be referred for a videostroboscopy, but at this time, the patient is not in need of this evaluation.  However, in the future if hoarseness returns, it is strongly recommended that he be referred for a videostroboscopy prior to returning to additional outpatient therapy.</p>
<p><b>LONG-TERM GOALS:</b><br />1.  The patient did reach his long-term goal of improved vocal quality to return to prior level of function and to utilize his voice in all settings without vocal hoarseness or difficulty.<br />2.  The patient appears very pleased with his return of his normal voice and feels that he no longer needs outpatient skilled speech therapy.</p>
<p>The patient is discharged from my services at this time with a home program to continue to promote normal voicing.</p>
