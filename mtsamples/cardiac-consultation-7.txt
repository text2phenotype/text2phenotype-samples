				<p><b>HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: </b> The patient is a 41-year-old African-American male previously well known to me.  He has a previous history of aortic valve disease, status post aortic valve replacement on 10/15/2007, for which he has been on chronic anticoagulation.  There is a previous history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, both of which have been stable prior to this admission.  He has a previous history of transient ischemic attack with no residual neurologic deficits.</p>
<p>The patient has undergone surgery by Dr. X for attempted nephrolithotomy.  The patient has experienced significant postoperative bleeding, for which it has been necessary to discontinue all anticoagulation.  The patient is presently seen at the request of Dr. X for management of anticoagulation and his above heart disease.</p>
<p><b>PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:</b><br />1.  Type I diabetes mellitus.<br />2.  Hyperlipidemia.<br />3.  Hypertension.<br />4.  Morbid obesity.<br />5.  Sleep apnea syndrome.<br />6.  Status post thyroidectomy for thyroid carcinoma.</p>
<p><b>REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:</b><br />General:  Unremarkable.<br />Cardiopulmonary:  No chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or dizziness.<br />Gastrointestinal:  Unremarkable.<br />Genitourinary:  See above.<br />Musculoskeletal:  Unremarkable.<br />Neurologic:  Unremarkable.</p>
<p><b>FAMILY HISTORY: </b> There are no family members with coronary artery disease.  His mother has congestive heart failure.</p>
<p><b>SOCIAL HISTORY:  </b>The patient is married.  He lives with his wife.  He is employed as a barber.  He does not use alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs.</p>
<p><b>MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:</b><br />1.  Clonidine 0.3 mg b.i.d.<br />2.  Atenolol 50 mg daily.<br />3.  Simvastatin 80 mg daily.<br />4.  Furosemide 40 mg daily.<br />5.  Metformin 1000 mg b.i.d.<br />6.  Hydralazine 25 mg t.i.d.<br />7.  Diovan 320 mg daily.<br />8.  Lisinopril 40 mg daily.<br />9.  Amlodipine 10 mg daily.<br />10.  Lantus insulin 50 units q.p.m.<br />11.  KCl 20 mEq daily.<br />12.  NovoLog sliding scale insulin coverage.<br />13.  Warfarin 7.5 mg daily.<br />14.  Levothyroxine 0.2 mg daily.<br />15.  Folic acid 1 mg daily.</p>
<p><b>ALLERGIES: </b> None.</p>
<p><b>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:</b><br />General:  A well-appearing, obese black male.<br />Vital Signs:  BP 140/80, HR 88, respirations 16, and afebrile.<br />HEENT:  Grossly normal.<br />Neck:  Normal.  Thyroid, normal.  Carotid, normal upstroke, no bruits.<br />Chest:  Midline sternotomy scar.<br />Lungs:  Clear.<br />Heart:  PMI fifth intercostal space mid clavicular line.  Normal S1 and prosthetic S2.  No murmur, rub, gallop, or click.<br />Abdomen:  Soft and nontender.  No palpable mass or hepatosplenomegaly.<br />Extremities:  Normal.  No edema.  Pulses bilaterally intact, carotid, radial, femoral, and dorsalis pedis.<br />Neurologic:  Mental status, no gross cranial nerve, motor, or sensory deficits.</p>
<p><b>ELECTROCARDIOGRAM: </b> Normal sinus rhythm.  Right bundle-branch block.  Findings compatible with old anteroseptal and lateral wall myocardial infarction.<br />_______ nonspecific ST-T abnormality.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION:</b><br />1.  Status post nephrolithotomy with postoperative hematuria.<br />2.  Aortic valve disease, status post aortic valve replacement on 10/15/2007.<br />3.  Congestive heart failure, diastolic, chronic, stable, NYSHA class I to II.<br />4.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.<br />5.  Status post remote transient ischemic attack with no residual neurologic deficits.<br />6.  Type I diabetes mellitus.<br />7.  Hyperlipidemia.<br />8.  Hypertension.<br />9.  Morbid obesity.<br />10.  Sleep apnea syndrome.<br />11.  Chronic therapeutic anticoagulation.</p>
<p><b>RECOMMENDATIONS:</b>  Until resolution of the hematuria, I agree with the necessity of discontinuation of all anticoagulation.  There is obvious risk both due to prosthetic aortic valve and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with continuation of anticoagulation; however, the risk of uncontrolled bleeding is essentially worse.<br />Continue other medications.</p>
