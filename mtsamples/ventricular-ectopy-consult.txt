<p><b>ALLERGIES: </b> THE PATIENT DOES HAVE ALLERGY TO MEDICATION.  HE SAID HE CANNOT TAKE ASPIRIN BECAUSE OF INTOLERANCE FOR HIS STOMACH AND STOMACH UPSET, BUT NO TRUE ALLERGY TO ASPIRIN.</p>
<p><b>FAMILY HISTORY:</b>  No history of premature coronary artery disease.  One daughter has early onset diabetes and one child has asthma.</p>
<p><b>SOCIAL HISTORY: </b> He is married and retired.  He has nine children, 25 grandchildren.  He smokes one pack per day.  He smoked 50 pack years and had no intention of quitting according to him.</p>
<p><b>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:</b><br />VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature of 97, heart rate of 90, blood pressure of 187/105.<br />HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  No thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.<br />NECK:  Supple.<br />CARDIOVASCULAR:  Upstroke is normal.  Distal pulse symmetrical.  Heart regular with a normal S1 with normally split S2.  There is an S4 at the apex.<br />LUNGS:  With decreased air entry.  No wheezes.<br />ABDOMINAL:  Benign.  No masses.<br />EXTREMITIES:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.<br />NEUROLOGIC:  Awake, alert, and oriented x3.  No focal deficits.</p>
<p><b>IMAGING STUDIES: </b> Echocardiogram on 08/26/2009, showed mild biatrial enlargement, normal thickening of the left ventricle with mildly dilated ventricle, EF of 40%, mild mitral regurgitation, and diastolic dysfunction, grade 2.</p>
<p>Nuclear stress study in 08/2009 showed fixed inferolateral defects, no reversible ischemia identified.</p>
<p>Chest x-ray upon this presentation showed no acute disease.</p>
<p><b>LABORATORY DATA:  </b>Showed normal white cells, hemoglobin 11.  BUN of 12.1, creatinine of 0.8.  Troponin of 0.04.  BNP of 5700.</p>
<p><b>ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:</b><br />1.  Elderly with cardiomyopathy, ischemic.  The patient presenting with exacerbation of symptoms.  He was not taking beta-blockers accurately.  He was on a lower dose of lisinopril, hypertension not optimal.  The patient at this time, maximum medical treatment will be recommended.  Recent testing showed no reversible ischemia.<br />2.  Consideration for EP consultation later for evaluation for ventricular tachycardia or necessity for defibrillator will be determined at a later time after the patient is treated for his COPD exacerbation and pneumonia.<br />3.  Continue metoprolol, would be better to have a little higher dose, we will increase it to 25 mg b.i.d.  Continue atorvastatin.<br />4.  Increase lisinopril to 20 mg daily to improve blood pressure management.<br />5.  Adding hydralazine also will be of help for blood pressure management.</p>
