<p>REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As mentioned above.</p>
<p><b>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:</b><br />GENERAL:  She is alert, awake, and oriented.<br />VITAL SIGNS:  Her blood pressure is about 132/72, heart rate of about 87 per minute, respiratory rate of 16.<br />HEENT:  Shows head is atraumatic.  Pupils are round and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  No oropharyngeal lesions noted.<br />NECK:  Supple, no JV distention, no carotid bruits, and no lymphadenopathy.<br />LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.<br />CARDIAC:  Reveals regular rate and rhythm.<br />ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Bowel sounds are normally present.<br />LOWER EXTREMITIES:  Shows no edema.  Distal pulses are 2+.<br />NEUROLOGICAL:  Grossly nonfocal.</p>
<p><b>LABORATORY DATA: </b> The database that is available at this point of time, WBC count is normal, hemoglobin and hematocrit are normal.  Sodium, potassium, chloride, glucose, bicarbonate, BUN and creatinine, and liver function tests are normal.  The patient&#8217;s 3 sets of cardiac enzymes including troponin-I, CPK-MB, and myoglobulin have been normal.  EKG is normal, sinus rhythm without any acute ST-T wave changes.  As mentioned before, the patient&#8217;s toxicology screen was positive for morphine, methadone, and marijuana.  The patient also had a head CT done in the emergency room, which was fairly unremarkable.  The patient&#8217;s beta-hCG level was marginally elevated at about 48.</p>
<p><b>ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION:</b><br />1.  Chest pains, appear to be completely noncardiac.  The patient does seem to have a psychosomatic component to her chest pain.  There is no evidence of acute coronary syndrome or unstable angina at this point of time.<br />2.  Possible early pregnancy.  The patient&#8217;s case was discussed with OB/GYN on-call over the phone.  Some of the medications have to be held secondary to potential danger.  The patient will follow up on an outpatient basis with her primary OB/GYN as well as PCP for the workup of her pregnancy as well as continuation of the pregnancy and prenatal visits.<br />3.  Migraine headaches for which the patient has been using her routine medications and the headaches seem to be under control.  Again, this is an outpatient diagnosis.  The patient will follow up with her PCP for control of migraine headache.</p>
<p>Overall prognosis is too soon to predict.</p>
<p>The plan is to discharge the patient home secondary to no evidence of acute coronary syndrome.</p>
