				<p><b>SUBJECTIVE:</b>  This 47-year-old white female presents with concern about possible spider bite to the left side of her neck.  She is not aware of any specific injury.  She noticed a little tenderness and redness on her left posterior shoulder about two days ago.  It seems to be getting a little bit larger in size, and she saw some red streaks extending up her neck.  She has had no fever.  The area is very minimally tender, but not particularly so.</p>
<p><b>CURRENT MEDICATIONS:</b>  Generic Maxzide, Climara patch, multivitamin, Tums, Claritin, and vitamin C.</p>
<p><b>ALLERGIES:</b>  No known medicine allergies.</p>
<p><b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br />Vital Signs:  Weight is 150 pounds.  Blood pressure 122/82.<br />Extremities:  Examination of the left posterior shoulder near the neckline is an area of faint erythema which is 6 cm in diameter.  In the center is a tiny mark which could certainly be an insect or spider bite.  There is no eschar there, but just a tiny marking.  There are a couple of erythematous streaks extending towards the neck.</p>
<p><b>ASSESSMENT:</b>  Possible insect bite with lymphangitis.</p>
<p><b>PLAN:</b><br />1.  Duricef 1 g daily for seven days.<br />2.  Cold packs to the area.<br />3.  Discussed symptoms that were suggestive of the worsening, in which case she would need to call me.<br />4.  Incidentally, she has noticed a little bit of dryness and redness on her eyelids, particularly the upper ones</p>
