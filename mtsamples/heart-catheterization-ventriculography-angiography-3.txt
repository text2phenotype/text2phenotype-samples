				<p><b>NAME OF PROCEDURE: </b> Left heart catheterization with ventriculography, selective coronary angiography.</p>
<p><b>INDICATIONS: </b> Acute coronary syndrome.</p>
<p><b>TECHNIQUE OF PROCEDURE: </b> Standard Judkins, right groin.  Catheters used were a 6 French pigtail, 6 French JL4, 6 French JR4.  </p>
<p><b>ANTICOAGULATION:  </b>The patient was on heparin at the time.</p>
<p><b>COMPLICATIONS: </b> None.</p>
<p>I reviewed with the patient the pros, cons, alternatives, risks of catheterization and sedation including myocardial infarction, stroke, death, damage to nerve, artery or vein in the leg, perforation of a cardiac chamber, dissection of an artery requiring countershock, infection, bleeding, ATN allergy, need for cardiac surgery.  All questions were answered, and the patient desired to proceed.</p>
<p><b>HEMODYNAMIC DATA:  </b>Aortic pressure was in the physiologic range.  No significant gradient across the aortic valve.</p>
<p><b>ANGIOGRAPHIC DATA</b><br />1. Ventriculogram:  The left ventricle is of normal size and shape, normal wall motion, normal ejection fraction.<br />2. Right coronary artery:  Dominant.  There was insignificant disease in the system.<br />3. Left coronary:  Left main, left anterior descending and circumflex systems showed no significant disease.</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSIONS</b><br />1. Normal left ventricular systolic function.<br />2. Insignificant coronary disease.</p>
<p><b>PLAN: </b> Based upon this study, medical therapy is warranted.  Six-French Angio-Seal was used in the groin.</p>
