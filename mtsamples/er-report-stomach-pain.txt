<p><b></b><b>HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:</b> The patient is a 45yo Mexican man without significant past medical history who presents to the emergency room with complaints of mid-epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain for the last 14 days.

It is relieved with standing and ambulation and exacerbated when lying in a supine position. He reports a decrease in appetite associated with a 4 lb. wt loss over the last 2 wks. He does have nausea with only one episode of non-bilious, non-bloody emesis on day of admission. He reports a 2 wk history of subjective fever and diaphoresis.
