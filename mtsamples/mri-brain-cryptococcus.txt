<p><b>COURSE:</b> Urinalysis revealed 1-2RBC, 2-3WBC and bacteria were noted. Repeat Urinalysis was negative the next day. PT, PTT, CXR and GS were normal. CBC revealed 10.4WBC with 7.1Granulocytes. HCT, 10/18/95, revealed hydrocephalus. MRI, 10/18/95, revealed ventriculomegaly of the lateral, 3rd and 4th ventricles. There was enhancement of the meninges about the prepontine cisterna and internal auditory canals, and enhancement of a scar or inflammed lining of the foramen of Magendie. These changes were felt suggestive of bacterial or granulomatous meningitis. The patient underwent ventriculostomy on 10/19/94. CSF taken on 10/19/94 via V-P shunt insertion revealed: 22 WBC (21 lymphocytes, 1 monocyte), 380 RBC, Glucose 58, Protein 29, GS negative, Cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB) negative, Cryptococcal Antigen and India Ink were negative. Numerous CSF samples were taken from the lumbar region and shunt reservoir and these were consistantly unremarkable except for an occasional CSF protein of up to 99mg/dl. Serum and CSF toxoplasma titers and ACE levels were negative on multiple occasions. VDRL and HIV testing was unremarkable. 10/27/94 and 10/31/94 CSF cultures taken from the cervical region eventually grew non-encapsulated crytococcus neoformans. The patient was treated with amphotericin and showed some improvement. However, scarring had probably occurred by then and the V-P shunt was left in place.</p>
