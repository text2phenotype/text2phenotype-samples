Opportunity for questions was provided and informed consent obtained.  After placing the patient in the left lateral decubitus position, the sigmoidoscope was inserted into the rectum and under direct visualization advanced to 25 cm.  Careful inspection was made as the sigmoidoscope was withdrawn.  The quality of the prep was good.  The procedure was stopped due to patient discomfort.  The patient otherwise tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.</p>
