				<p><b>PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: </b> Cataract, right eye.</p>
<p><b>POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:</b>  Cataract, right eye.</p>
<p><b>TITLE OF OPERATION:  </b>Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens insertion, right eye.</p>
<p><b>ANESTHESIA: </b> Retrobulbar block.</p>
<p><b>COMPLICATIONS: </b> None.</p>
<p><b>PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  </b>The patient was brought to the operating room where retrobulbar anesthesia was induced.  The patient was then prepped and draped using standard procedure.  A wire lid speculum was inserted to keep the eye open and the eye rotated downward with a 0.12.  The anterior chamber was entered by making a small superior limbal incision with a crescent blade and then entering the anterior chamber with a keratome.  The chamber was then filled with viscoelastic and a continuous-tear capsulorrhexis performed.  The phacoemulsification was then instilled in the eye and a linear incision made in the lens.  The lens was then cracked with a McPherson forceps, and the remaining lens material removed with the phacoemulsification tip.  The remaining cortex was removed with an I&#038;A.  The capsular bag was then inflated with viscoelastic and the wound extended slightly with the keratome.  The folding posterior chamber lens was then inserted in the capsular bag and rotated into position.  The remaining viscoelastic was removed from the eye with the I&#038;A.  The wound was checked for watertightness and found to be watertight.  Tobramycin drops were instilled in the eye and a shield placed over it.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.</p>
