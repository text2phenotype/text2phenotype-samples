				<p><b>CHIEF COMPLAINT: </b> Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever.</p>
<p><b>HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: </b> This patient is a 76-year-old woman who was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and intravenous clindamycin at a care facility for pneumonia.  She has developed worsening confusion, fever, and intractable diarrhea.  She was brought to the emergency department for evaluation.  Diagnostic studies in the emergency department included a CBC, which revealed a white blood cell count of 23,500, and a low potassium level of 2.6.  She was admitted to the hospital for treatment of profound hypokalemia, dehydration, intractable diarrhea, and febrile illness.</p>
<p><b>PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: </b> Recent history of pneumonia, urosepsis, dementia, amputation, osteoporosis, and hypothyroidism.</p>
<p><b>MEDICATIONS:  </b>Synthroid, clindamycin, ceftriaxone, Remeron, Actonel, Zanaflex, and hydrocodone.</p>
<p><b>SOCIAL HISTORY: </b> The patient has been residing at South Valley Care Center.</p>
<p><b>REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: </b> The patient is unable answer review of systems.</p>
<p><b>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:</b><br />GENERAL:  This is a very elderly, cachectic woman lying in bed in no acute distress.<br />HEENT:  Examination is normocephalic and atraumatic.  The pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.  The extraocular movements are full.<br />NECK:  Supple with full range of motion and no masses.<br />LUNGS:  There are decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.<br />CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2, and no S3 or S4.<br />ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly.<br />EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.<br />NEUROLOGIC:  The patient moves all extremities but does not communicate.</p>
<p><b>DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: </b> The CBC shows a white blood cell count of 23,500, hemoglobin 13.0, hematocrit 36.3, and platelets 287,000.  The basic chemistry panel is remarkable for potassium 2.6, calcium 7.5, and albumin 2.3.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION/PLAN:</b><br />1.  Elevated white count.  This patient is admitted to the hospital for treatment of a febrile illness.  There is concern that she has a progression of pneumonia.  She may have aspirated.  She has been treated with ceftriaxone and clindamycin.  I will follow her oxygen saturation and chest x-ray closely.  She is allergic to penicillin.  Therefore, clindamycin is the appropriate antibiotic for possible aspiration.<br />2.  Intractable diarrhea.  The patient has been experiencing intractable diarrhea.  I am concerned about Clostridium difficile infection with possible pseudomembranous colitis.  I will send her stool for Clostridium difficile toxin assay.  I will consider treating with metronidazole.<br />3.  Hypokalemia.  The patient&#8217;s profound hypokalemia is likely secondary to her diarrhea.  I will treat her with supplemental potassium.<br />4.  DNR status:  I have ad a discussion with the patient&#8217;s daughter, who requests the patient not receive CPR or intubation if her clinical condition or of the patient does not respond to the above therapy.  </p>
