				<p><b>ATHLETE&#8217;S FOOT, TINEA PEDIS,</b> is a very common fungal skin infection of the foot.  It often first appears between the toes.  It can be a one-time occurrence or it can be chronic.  The fungus, known as Trichophyton, thrives under warm, damp conditions so people whose feet sweat a great deal are more susceptible.  It is easily transmitted in showers and pool walkways.  Those people with immunosuppressive conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, are also more susceptible to athlete&#8217;s foot.</p>
<p><b>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:</b><br />*  Itchy feet.<br />*  White or red and soft scaling on feet, usually in between toes.<br />*  Small blisters may be present.<br />*  Bad foot odor.<br />*  Very rare involvement of hands and simultaneously (called an Id reaction).</p>
<p><b>TREATMENT:</b><br />*  Diagnosis is via symptoms or sometimes by examining skin scrapings under a microscope..  A bacterial infection may also be suspected in which case a skin culture will confirm this.<br />*  Try a non-prescription antifungal powder or cream available in drugstores; your doctor can prescribe a stronger topical antifungal medication if necessary.<br />*  Oral antibiotics may be prescribed for a possible bacterial infection.<br />*  Keep feet as dry as possible! Change socks twice a day if necessary and wear those made of natural fibers, such as cotton.  Go barefoot when you have a chance or wear sandals.  Dry thoroughly in between toes after swimming or bathing.<br />*  A special powder to absorb moisture on feet is also available in drugstores.  Ask the pharmacist about this.<br />*  Spray your shower at home with a 10% bleach solution after bathing.  This may help decrease the chance that other family members will be infected.<br />*  Wear sandals or thongs in public showers and around pools.<br />*  Keep in mind that it may take up to a month or more to get rid of your athlete&#8217;s foot.  Be diligent in using the antifungal medication.  Unfortunately, recurrence of athlete&#8217;s foot is common.  Luckily, the condition does not cause serious problems for the majority of people who have it.<br />*  Call the office if your athlete&#8217;s foot spreads or worsens despite treatment.</p>
<p><b>PLANTAR FASCIAL STRETCHES</b><br />1.  Raise toes toward you while bending your ankle as high as you can.<br />2.  Hold this position for 15 seconds.<br />3.  Alternate doing this with the opposite foot 10 times.<br />4.  Perform this exercise 2- 3 times a day.</p>
<p><b>WOUND CARE INSTRUCTIONS</b><br />1.  Clean the area daily with soap and water.<br />2.  Every day apply a thin coat of polysporin ointment.<br />3.  Change the dressing daily and keep the area covered with an adhesive bandage until completely healed.<br />4.  Notify the office if you have any increasing wound pain or any evidence of infection.</p>
