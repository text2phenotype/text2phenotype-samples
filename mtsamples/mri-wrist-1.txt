				<p>This is a 30-year-old female with pain and swelling, status post injury.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS:</b><br />There are posttraumatic cysts along the volar midline and volar lateral aspects of the lunate which are likely posttraumatic. There is no acute marrow edema (series #12 images #5-7). Marrow signal is otherwise normal in the distal radius and ulna, throughout the carpals and throughout the proximal metacarpals.</p>
<p>There is a partial tear of the volar component of the scapholunate ligament in the region of the posttraumatic lunate cyst with retraction and thickening towards the scaphoid (series #6 image #5, series #8 images #22-36). There is tearing of the membranous portion of the ligament. The dorsal component is intact.</p>
<p>The lunatotriquetral ligament is thickened and lax, but intact (series #8 image #32).</p>
<p>There is no tearing of the radial or ulnar attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage (series #6 image #7). There is a mildly positive ulnar variance. Normal ulnar collateral ligament.</p>
<p>The patient was positioned in dorsiflexion. Carpal alignment is normal and there are no tears of the dorsal or ventral intercarpal ligaments (series #14 image #9).</p>
<p>There is a longitudinal split tear of the ECU tendon which is enlarged both at the level of and distal to the ulnar styloid with severe synovitis (series #4 images #8-16, series #3 images #9-16).</p>
<p>There is thickening of the extensor tendon sheaths within the fourth dorsal compartment with intrinsically normal tendons (series #4 image #12).</p>
<p>There is extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis synovitis in the second dorsal compartment (series #4 image #13).</p>
<p>Normal flexor tendons within the carpal tunnel. There is mild thickening of the tendon sheaths and the median nerve demonstrates increased signal without compression or enlargement (series #3 image #7, series #4 image #7).</p>
<p>There are no pathological cysts or soft tissue masses.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION:</b><br />Partial tear of the volar and membranous components of the scapholunate ligament with an associated posttraumatic cyst in the lunate. There is thickening and laxity of the lunatotriquetral ligament.</p>
<p>Longitudinal split tear of the ECU tendon with tendinosis and severe synovitis.</p>
<p>Synovitis of the second dorsal compartment and tendon sheath thickening in the fourth dorsal compartment.</p>
<p>Tendon sheath thickening within the carpal tunnel with increased signal within the median nerve.</p>
