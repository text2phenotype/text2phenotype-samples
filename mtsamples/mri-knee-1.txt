				<p><b>EXAM:</b>MRI LEFT KNEE WITHOUT CONTRAST</p>
<p><b>CLINICAL:</b>Left knee pain.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS:</b><br />Comparison is made with 10/13/05 radiographs.</p>
<p>There is a prominent suprapatellar effusion. Patient has increased signal within the medial collateral ligament as well as fluid around it, compatible with type 2 sprain. There is fluid around the lateral collateral ligament without increased signal within the ligament itself, compatible with type 1 sprain.</p>
<p>Medial and lateral menisci contain some minimal increased signal centrally that does not extend through an articular surface and findings are felt to represent minimal myxoid degeneration. No tear is seen. Anterior cruciate and posterior cruciate ligaments are intact. There is a bone bruise of medial patellar facet measuring approximately 8 x 5 mm. There is suggestion of some mild posterior aspect of the lateral tibial plateau. MR signal on the bone marrow is otherwise normal.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION:</b><br />Type 2 sprain in the medial collateral ligament and type sprain in the lateral collateral ligament.</p>
<p>Joint effusion and bone bruise with suggestion of some minimal overlying chondromalacia and medial patellar facet.</p>
