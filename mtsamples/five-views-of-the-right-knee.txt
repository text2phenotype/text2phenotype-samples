<p><b>HISTORY: </b> Pain.  The patient is status-post surgery, he could not straighten his leg, pain in the back of the knee.</p>
<p><b>TECHNIQUE:</b>  Five views of the right knee were evaluated.  There are no priors for comparison.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS: </b> Five views of the right knee were evaluated and they reveal there is no evidence of any displaced fractures, dislocations, or subluxations.  There are multiple areas of growth arrest lines seen in the distal aspect of the femur and proximal aspect of the tibia.  There is also appearance of a high-riding patella suggestive of patella alta.</p>
