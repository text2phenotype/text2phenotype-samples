				<p><b>PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: </b> Right hemothorax.</p>
<p><b>POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: </b> Right hemothorax.</p>
<p><b>PROCEDURE PERFORMED: </b> Insertion of a #32 French chest tube on the right hemithorax.</p>
<p><b>ANESTHESIA: </b> 1% Lidocaine and sedation.</p>
<p><b>INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:</b>  This is a 54-year-old female with a newly diagnosed carcinoma of the cervix.  The patient is to have an Infuse-A-Port insertion today.  Postoperatively from that, she started having a blood tinged pink frothy sputum.  Chest x-ray was obtained and showed evidence of a hemothorax on the right hand side, opposite side of the Infuse-A-Port and a wider mediastinum.  The decision was made to place a chest tube in the right hemithorax to allow for the patient to be stable for transfer out of the operating room.</p>
<p><b>DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: </b> The area was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The area was anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine solution.  The patient was given sedation.  A #10 blade scalpel was used to make an incision approximately 1.5 cm long.  Then a curved scissor was used to dissect down to the level of the rib.  A blunt peon was then used to again enter into the right hemithorax.  Immediately a blood tinged effusion was released.  The chest tube was placed and directed in a posterior and superior direction.  The chest tube was hooked up to the Pleur-evac device which was ________ tip suction.  The chest tube was tied in with a #0 silk suture in a U-stitch fashion.  It was sutured in place with sterile dressing and silk tape.  The patient tolerated this procedure well.  We will obtain a chest x-ray in postop to ensure proper placement and continue to follow the patient very closely.</p>
