                                         Discussed with family- explained that
                                         Heparin prevents clots from forming but does
                                         not lyse clots. Patient was on Ecotrin, Plavix
                                         & Heparin so there is a danger of a stroke or
                                         a small bleed & that we would do a CT scan
                                         immediately to assure that there was no
                                         bleeding.

                                         Plan:
                                         1. Review CT scan.
                                         2. Continue IV fluids, keep BP at 140 -150,
