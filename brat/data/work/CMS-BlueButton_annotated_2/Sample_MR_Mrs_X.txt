ID: This is a 42 year old woman


Chief Complaint: Pain and swelling in the lower right leg.

HPI: This is a 42 year old lady who travels frequently, has a history of melanoma, and
h/o traumatic splenectomy who comes in today with a 4 day history of intermittent,
stabbing pain in the right leg near the calf. On Friday she returned from a business trip in
Ireland. On Saturday morning she was running when she fell and abraded her right lower
leg. She thinks that she tripped, as this was early in the morning and it was dark. She
cleaned the wound and applied Neosporin. The pain developed that day in her calf, in an
area of the leg close to but not within the abraded area. She describes the pain as stabbing
and sometimes throbbing, with a 3-5 pain rating on a scale of 1-10. It seems to be
ameliorated by elevation, ice and Ibuprofen. The pain comes more frequently with
walking, and has interfered with both her exercise and her work. It is also worse when
she presses on the area. The pain is getting worse. She says the scraped area appears to be
healing. She denies any feeling of tiredness, fever, chills, paresthesia, numbness and is
able to walk on the leg. She also denies any chest pain or shortness of breath. swelling in
the leg She has never been previously diagnosed with a blood clot. She is a smoker, 20
pack years. She is not on birth control. She has no history of hypertension. 12 years ago
she had a splenectomy following an accident, and says she has had the vaccinations her
doctor recommended. 10 years ago she had a melanoma of unknown stage removed from
her left arm, and continues to follow up with her dermatologist.

Problem List:

    1. Painful lower right leg
    2. Abraded lower right leg
    3. Melanoma
    4. High cholesterol, controlled with Lipitor
    5. Smoking
    6. Splenectomy
    7. History of melanoma
    8. Familial History of Colon Cancer
Differential Diagnosis:

   1. Deep Vein Thrombosis: This patient’s history of smoking, recent stasis with
      travel and a possibility of cancer recurrence make DVT a possible diagnosis.
      DVT is also the most immediately fatal possibility, and so it must be considered
      first. It is not the DVT itself that is dangerous, for there is usually enough
      compensating veins to return the blood eventually, but rather the pulmonary
      embolism that can result when a DVT moves from its original position. 5-20% of
      Calf DVTs progress to pulmonary embolism, and 20-30% progress to the thigh,
      which increases the chances of pulmonary embolism to 50%1. According to
      Harrison’s Principle of Internal Medicine, a DVT in the calf is difficult to
      diagnosis from physical examination alone. Symptoms may include “calf pain…
      posterior calf tenderness, warmth, increased tissue turgor or modest swelling…
      Homans’ sign is an unreliable diagnostic sign.”2 By Wells' Pretest Probability
        criteria of suspected Deep Vein Thrombosis, this patient has a score of -2, giving
        her a Low pretest probability. Even if she does have an undiagnosed active
        cancer, her score would be in the same probability with a score of -1. Therefore, a
        negative ultrasound of the area is enough to rule out a DVT. In addition, a D-
        Dimer result of less than 200 to 500 ng/mL with a Low Wells score has a 99%
        negative predictive value for ruling out DVT. However, these scores were
        developed in secondary care centers, and patients presenting to primary care have
        a higher rate of missed DVT. 3 Therefore, an ultrasound should be done,
        regardless of the D-Dimer score.
   2.   Stress Fracture of the Tibia: Many of the patient’s symptoms are suggestive of a
        stress fracture: she has a sharp, localized pain and tenderness, some swelling
        without erythema, and the pain is exacerbated with walking. Stress fractures often
        occur in athletes such as runners from overuse, but other causes can include poor
        footwear, running on uneven terrain, and nutrition problems such as anorexia and
        osteoporosis. An x-ray could confirm a stress fracture, but confirmation occurs
        less than 50% of the time in the first two weeks following the injury. Mild stress
        fractures are treated with elevation and ice, and switching or avoiding the exercise
        that caused the fracture for 6 weeks. 4
   3.   Muscle Strain: It is possible that this lady has pulled a muscle in her leg.
        Diagnosis of a muscle injury when there is no restriction in movement is difficult,
        and the treatment is the same as for a stress fracture.
   4.   Cellulitis: Cellulitis in a lower limb is always a differential diagnosis for DVT. I
        think an infection of the skin is unlikely in this patient because there is no
        erythema, local lymphadenopathy, abscesses or lesions. Also the pain is coming
        from deep in the leg, not the upper skin and fat layer. Her history of splenectomy
        makes the possibility of infection by encapsulated bacteria worrisome, but at this
        point her symptoms suggest a different diagnosis.5
   5.   Ruptured Baker’s Cyst: A Baker’s cyst is a popliteal bursitis that results from
        overuse of the knee. This patient has no history suggestive of a Baker’s Cyst,
        since there was no pain, swelling, or movement restriction of the knee prior to her
        fall. A ruptured Baker’s Cyst can result in pain in the posterior calf muscles, and
        treatment is directed to the underlying cause or disease. 6

Plan:

Diagnostic: I recommend immediate duplex venous ultrasonography of her right lower
leg. The sensitivity of this test for calf DVT is 75%. I would not do a D-Dimer test, since
both a positive and a negative D-Dimer will lead to an ultrasound as the next step. Her
pre-test probability of DVT is low, so provided the D-Dimer test is negative, I would
Therapeutic plan: advise this patient to continue to let the leg rest as she has been doing,
with elevation and ice. An x-ray for a stress fracture of the tibia is positive less than 50%
of the time in the first two weeks following an injury, so I would get an x-ray but treat
even if negative. If a stress fracture is diagnosed, we would need to talk about footwear,
proper running technique, nutrition, etc. Crutches might be helpful if walking continues
to be a problem. She may return to work provided she not doing any strenuous activity
while there. If she noted any changes in the pain or in the wound, I would advise her to
come back in for further
examination. If she has any shortness of breath, she should go immediately to the
emergency room.
Patient Education: Move around more when flying to avoid DVT
