				<p><b>EXAM: </b> Left heart cath, selective coronary angiogram, right common femoral angiogram, and StarClose closure of right common femoral artery.</p>
<p><b>REASON FOR EXAM: </b> Abnormal stress test and episode of shortness of breath.</p>
<p><b>PROCEDURE: </b> Right common femoral artery, 6-French sheath, JL4, JR4, and pigtail catheters were used.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS:</b><br />1.  Left main is a large-caliber vessel.  It is angiographically free of disease,<br />2.  LAD is a large-caliber vessel.  It gives rise to two diagonals and septal perforator.  It erupts around the apex.  LAD shows an area of 60% to 70% stenosis probably in its mid portion.  The lesion is a type A finishing before the takeoff of diagonal 1.  The rest of the vessel is angiographically free of disease.<br />3.  Diagonal 1 and diagonal 2 are angiographically free of disease.<br />4.  Left circumflex is a small-to-moderate caliber vessel, gives rise to 1 OM.  It is angiographically free of disease.<br />5.  OM-1 is angiographically free of disease.<br />6.  RCA is a large, dominant vessel, gives rise to conus, RV marginal, PDA and one PL.  RCA has a tortuous course and it has a 30% to 40% stenosis in its proximal portion.<br />7.  LVEDP is measured 40 mmHg.<br />8.  No gradient between LV and aorta is noted.</p>
<p>Due to contrast concern due to renal function, no LV gram was performed.</p>
<p>Following this, right common femoral angiogram was performed followed by StarClose closure of the right common femoral artery.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION:</b><br />1.  60% to 70% mid left anterior descending stenosis.<br />2.  Mild 30% to 40% stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery.<br />3.  Status post StarClose closure of the right common femoral artery.</p>
<p><b>PLAN:  </b>Plan will be to perform elective PCI of the mid LAD.</p>
