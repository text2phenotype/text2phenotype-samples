His wife described his speech as &quot;word salad&quot; and &quot;complete gibberish.&quot; She immediately took him to a local hospital . Enroute, he was initially able to understand what was spoken to him. By the time he arrived at the hospital at 6:45AM, he was unable to follow commands. His speech was reportedly unintelligible the majority of the time, and some of the health care workers thought he was speaking a foreign language. There were no other symptoms or signs.

<p>In addition, he had noted memory and word finding difficulty for 2 months prior to presentation. He had undergone a gastrectomy 16 years prior for peptic ulcer disease. His local physician found him vitamin B12 deficient and he was placed on vitamin B12 and folate supplementation 2 months prior to presentation.

On rare occasions, he uttered short comments appropriately. Speech was marred by semantic and phonemic paraphasias. He named colors and described most actions well, although he described a &quot;faucet dripping&quot; as a &quot;faucet drop.&quot; He called &quot;red&quot; &quot;reed.&quot; Reading comprehension was better than aural comprehension. He demonstrated excellent written calculations. Spoken calculations were accurate except when the calculations became more complex. For example, he said that ten percent of 100 was equal to &quot;1,200.&quot;</p>
