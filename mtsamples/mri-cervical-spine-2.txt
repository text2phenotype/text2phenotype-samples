				<p><b>EXAM:</b>MRI SPINAL CORD CERVICAL WITHOUT CONTRAST</p>
<p><b>CLINICAL:</b>Right arm pain, numbness and tingling.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS:</b><br />Vertebral alignment and bone marrow signal characteristics are unremarkable. The C2-3 and C3-4 disk levels appear unremarkable.</p>
<p>At C4-5, broad based disk/osteophyte contacts the ventral surface of the spinal cord and may mildly indent the cord contour. A discrete cord signal abnormality is not identified. There may also be some narrowing of the neuroforamina at this level.</p>
<p>At C5-6, central disk-osteophyte contacts and mildly impresses on the ventral cord contour. Distinct neuroforaminal narrowing is not evident.</p>
<p>At C6-7, mild diffuse disk-osteophyte impresses on the ventral thecal sac and contacts the ventral cord surface. Distinct cord compression is not evident. There may be mild narrowing of the neuroforamina at his level.</p>
<p>A specific abnormality is not identified at the C7-T1 level.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION:</b><br />Disk/osteophyte at C4-5 through C6-7 with contact and may mildly indent the ventral cord contour at these levels. Some possible neuroforaminal narrowing is also noted at levels as stated above.</p>
