				<p><b>PROCEDURES:</b><br />1.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy.<br />2.  Colonoscopy with polypectomy.</p>
<p><b>PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:</b><br />1.  History of esophageal cancer.<br />2.  History of colonic polyps.</p>
<p><b>POSTOPERATIVE FINDINGS:</b><br />1.  Intact surgical intervention for a history of esophageal cancer.<br />2.  Melanosis coli.<br />3.  Transverse colon polyps in the setting of surgical changes related to partial and transverse colectomy.</p>
<p><b>MEDICATIONS:</b>  Fentanyl 250 mcg and 9 mg of Versed.</p>
<p><b>INDICATIONS:</b>  The patient is a 55-year-old dentist presenting for surveillance upper endoscopy in the setting of a history of esophageal cancer with staging at T2N0M0.</p>
<p>He also has a history of adenomatous polyps and presents for surveillance of this process.</p>
<p>Informed consent was obtained after explanation of the procedures, as well as risk factors of bleeding, perforation, and adverse medication reaction.</p>
<p><b>ESOPHAGOGASTRODUODENOSCOPY:</b>  The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and medicated with the above medications to achieve and maintain a conscious sedation.  Vital signs were monitored throughout the procedure without evidence of hemodynamic compromise or desaturation.  The Olympus single-channel endoscope was passed under direct visualization, through the oral cavity, and advanced to the second portion of the duodenum.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS:</b><br />1.  ESOPHAGUS:  Anatomy consistent with esophagectomy with colonic transposition.<br />2.  STOMACH:  Revealed colonic transposition with normal mucosa.<br />3.  DUODENUM:  Normal.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION: </b> Intact surgical intervention with esophagectomy colonic transposition.</p>
<p><b>COLONOSCOPY: </b> The patient was then turned and a colonic 140-series colonoscope was passed under direct visualization through the anal verge and advanced to the cecum as identified by the appendiceal orifice.  Circumferential visualization the colonic mucosa revealed the following:<br />1.  Cecum revealed melanosis coli.<br />2.  Ascending, melanosis coli.<br />3.  Transverse revealed two diminutive sessile polyps, excised by cold forceps technique and submitted to histology as specimen #1 with surgical changes consistent with partial colectomy related to the colonic transposition.<br />4.  Descending, melanosis coli.<br />5.  Sigmoid, melanosis coli.<br />6.  Rectum, melanosis coli.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION: </b> Diffuse melanosis coli with incidental finding of transverse colon polyps.</p>
<p><b>RECOMMENDATION: </b> Follow-up histology.  Continue fiber with avoidance of stimulant laxatives.</p>
