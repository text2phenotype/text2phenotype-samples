				<p><b>DIAGNOSIS:</b>  Status post brain tumor removal.</p>
<p><b>HISTORY:</b>  The patient is a 64-year-old female referred to physical therapy following complications related to brain tumor removal.  The patient reports that on 10/24/08 she had a brain tumor removed and had left-sided weakness.  The patient was being seen in physical therapy from 11/05/08 to 11/14/08 then she began having complications.  The patient reports that she was admitted to Hospital on 12/05/08.  At that time, they found massive swelling on the brain and a second surgery was performed.  The patient then remained in acute rehab until she was discharged to home on 01/05/09.  The patient&#8217;s husband, Al, is also present and he reports that during rehabilitation the patient did have a DVT in the left calf that has since been resolved.</p>
<p><b>PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: </b> Unremarkable.</p>
<p><b>MEDICATIONS:  </b>Coumadin, Keppra, Decadron, and Glucophage.</p>
<p><b>SUBJECTIVE: </b> The patient reports that the pain is not an issue at this time.  The patient states that her primary concern is her left-sided weakness as related to her balance and her walking and her left arm weakness.</p>
<p><b>PATIENT GOAL:  </b>To increase strength in her left leg for better balance and walking.</p>
<p><b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br />RANGE OF MOTION:  Bilateral lower extremities are within normal limits.<br />STRENGTH:  Bilateral lower extremities are grossly 5/5 with one repetition, except left hip reflexion 4+/5.<br />BALANCE:  The patient&#8217;s balance was assessed with a Berg balance test.  The patient has got 46/56 points, which places her at moderate risk for falls.<br />GAIT:  The patient ambulates with contact guard assist.  The patient ambulates with a reciprocal gait pattern with good bilateral foot clearance.  However, the patient has been reports that with increased fatigue, left footdrop tends to occur.  A 6-minute walk test will be performed at the next visit due to time constraints.</p>
<p><b>ASSESSMENT: </b> The patient is a 64-year-old female referred to Physical Therapy status post brain surgery.  Examination indicates deficits in strength, balance, and ambulation.  The patient will benefit from skilled physical therapy to address these impairments.</p>
<p><b>TREATMENT PLAN: </b> The patient will be seen three times per week for 4 weeks and then reduce it to two times per week for 4 additional weeks.  Interventions include:<br />1.  Therapeutic exercise.<br />2.  Balance training.<br />3.  Gait training.<br />4.  Functional mobility training.</p>
<p><b>SHORT TERM GOAL TO BE COMPLETED IN 4 WEEKS:</b><br />1.  The patient is to tolerate 30 repetitions of all lower extremity exercises.<br />2.  The patient is to improve balance with a score of 50/56 points.<br />3.  The patient is to ambulate 1000 feet in a 6-minute walk test with standby assist.</p>
<p><b>LONG TERM GOAL TO BE ACHIEVED IN 8 WEEKS:</b><br />1.  The patient is to ambulate independently within her home and standby to general supervision within the community.<br />2.  Berg balance test to be 52/56.<br />3.  The patient is to ambulate a 6-minute walk test for 1500 feet independently including safe negotiation of corners and busy areas.<br />4.  The patient is to demonstrate safely stepping over and around objects without loss of balance.</p>
<p>Prognosis for the above-stated goals is good.  The above treatment plan has been discussed with the patient and her husband.  They are in agreement.</p>
