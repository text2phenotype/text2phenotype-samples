Note: Values in parentheses after gene amplifications and small variants provide estimates of relative coverage (e.g. 5x) and mutation allele frequency (e.g. 55%), respectively. In
the GPS Cancer findings diagram above, predicted protein changes found to be expressed in the RNA sequencing data are denoted by filled circles (RNA+), while empty circles
indicate variants not expressed at a detectable level (RNA-).
