Three other individuals in the house were lethargic and complained of HA that same morning. Her last memory was talking to her granddaughter at 5:00PM on 1/16/96. She next remembered riding in the ambulance from a Hospital. Initial Carboxyhemoglobin level was 24% (normal &lt; 1.5%) and ABG 7.41/30/370 with O2Sat 75% on 100%FiO2.</p>

<p><b>EXAM: </b>BP126/91, HR86, RR 30, 37.1C.<br /><b>MS:</b> Oriented to name only. Speech without dysarthria. 2/3 recall at 5minutes.<br /><b>CN:</b> unremarkable.<br /><b>MOTOR: </b>full strength throughout with normal muscle tone and bulk.<br /><b>SENSORY: </b>unremarkable.<br /><b>COORD/STATION:</b> unremarkable.<br /><b>GAIT:</b> not tested on admission.<br /><b>GEN EXAM:</b> notable for erythema of the face and chest.</p>
<p><b>COURSE:</b> She underwent a total of four dives under Hyperbaric Oxygen ( 2 dives on 1/17 and 2 dives on 1/18). Neuropsychologic assessment on 1/18/96 revealed marked cognitive impairments with defects in anterograde memory, praxis, associative fluency, attention, and speed of information processing. She was discharged home on 1/19/96 and returned on 2/11/96 after neurologic deterioration. She progressively developed more illogical behavior, anhedonia, anorexia and changes in sleep pattern. She became completely dependent and could not undergo repeat neuropsychologic assessment in 2/96. She was later transferred to another care facility against medical advice. The etiology for these changes became complicated by a newly discovered history of possible ETOH abuse and usual &quot;anxiety&quot; disorder.</p>
<p>MRI brain, 2/14/96, revealed increased T2 signal within the periventricular white matter, bilaterally. EEG showed diffuse slowing without epileptiform activity.</p>
