<p><b>HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  </b>A pleasant 43-year-old female with past medical history of CP since birth, seizure disorder, complex partial seizure with secondary generalization and on top of generalized epilepsy, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity.  The patient stated she was in her normal state of well being when she was experiencing having frequent seizures.  She lives in assisted living.  She has been falling more frequently.  The patient was driving a scooter and apparently was hitting into the wall with unresponsiveness in association with this.  There was no head trauma, but apparently she was doing that many times and there was no responsiveness.  The patient has no memory of the event.  She is now back to her baseline.  She states her seizures are worse in the setting of stress, but it is not clear to her why this has occurred.  She is on Carbatrol 300 mg b.i.d. and she has been very compliant and without any problems.  The patient is admitted for EMU monitoring for the characterization of these episodes and for the possibility of complex partial epilepsy syndrome or better characterization of this current syndrome.</p>
