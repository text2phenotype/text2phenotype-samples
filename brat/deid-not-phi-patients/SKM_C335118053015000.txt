Point of discussion:
A 28-year old patient recently diagnosed with a cervical adenosquamous
carcinoma (grade 2 out of 3), FIGO IB2 is being presented today to discuss
further management of her disease.
Patient summary:
A 28 y/o patient presents to our department with a 36.5 weeks
pregnancy and a friable cervical mass of more than 4cm highly
suspicious for malignancy. The patient was seen earlier at her hospital
but denied any treatment and favored to pursue her pregancy. A
concomitant cesarean delivery and immediate type lll radical
hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy were planned and
performed in this patient. The estimated blood loss was 2000.
Baby and mother did well and were discharged postop day #4.
Rational for the recommendations:
Patient had:
• Deep stromal invasion, 15/17 mm
Tumor size of 4.5 cm
• Positive lymphovascular invasion
Recommandations
• Offered enrollment on GOG 263, RT+ chemo, declined (too anxious
about chemotherapy)
• Recommended to receive adjuvant radiation
Patient was offered counseling about radiation therapy long term toxicity
o Vaginal stenosis, dilator can prevent
o Pelvic insufficiency fracture, (~10%)
o Damage to bowel or bladder, (<5%)
o Radiation induced malignancy(<1%)
Next steps:
•
Patient will receive adjuvan radiation therapy whole pelvic radiation to
45 Gy using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) at an outside
institution.
Patient will be seen at 4 and 8 months after completion of the radiation
therapy unless if needed earlier.
PAP smear to be performed every 6 months
