<p><b>DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  </b>The patient was brought to the operating room, prepped and draped in lithotomy position under satisfactory general anesthesia.  A #21-French cystourethroscope was inserted into the bladder.  Examination of the bladder showed approximately a 3-cm area of erythema and recurrent papillomatosis just above and lateral to the left ureteral orifice.  No other lesions were noted.
