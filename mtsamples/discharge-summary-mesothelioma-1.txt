<p><b>LABORATORY DATA: </b> Labs are pending.</p>
<p><b>HOSPITAL COURSE: </b> The patient was admitted for a right-sided pleural effusion for thoracentesis on Monday by Dr. X.  Her Coumadin was placed on hold.  A repeat echocardiogram was checked.  She was started on prophylaxis for DVT with Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously.  Her history dated back to March 2005 when she first sought medical attention for evidence of pericarditis, which was treated with pericardial window in an outside hospital, at that time she was also found to have mesenteric pain and thrombosis, is now anticoagulated.  Her pericardial fluid was accumulated and she was seen by Dr. Y.  At that time, she was recommended for pericardectomy, which was performed by Dr. Z.  Review of her CT scan from March 2006 prior to her pericardectomy, already shows bilateral plural effusions.  The patient improved clinically after the pericardectomy with resolution of her symptoms.  Recently, she was readmitted to the hospital with chest pain and found to have bilateral pleural effusion, the right greater than the left.  CT of the chest also revealed a large mediastinal lymph node.  We reviewed the pathology obtained from the pericardectomy in March 2006, which was diagnostic of mesothelioma.  At this time, chest tube placement for drainage of the fluid occurred and thoracoscopy with fluid biopsies, which were performed, which revealed epithelioid malignant mesothelioma.  The patient was then stained with a PET CT, which showed extensive uptake in the chest, bilateral pleural pericardial effusions, and lymphadenopathy.  She also had acidic fluid, pectoral and intramammary lymph nodes and uptake in L4 with SUV of 4.  This was consistent with stage III disease.  Her repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 45% to 49%.  She was transferred to Oncology service and started on chemotherapy on September 1, 2007 with cisplatin 75 mg/centimeter squared equaling 109 mg IV piggyback over 2 hours on September 1, 2007, Alimta 500 mg/ centimeter squared equaling 730 mg IV piggyback over 10 minutes.  This was all initiated after a Port-A-Cath was placed.  The chemotherapy was well tolerated and the patient was discharged the following day after discontinuing IV fluid and IV.  Her Port-A-Cath was packed with heparin according to protocol.</p>
<p><b>DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: </b> Zofran, Phenergan, Coumadin, and Lovenox, and Vicodin</p>
<p><b>DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:</b>  She was instructed to followup with Dr. XYZ in the office to check her INR on Tuesday.  She was instructed to call if she had any other questions or concerns in the interim.</p>
