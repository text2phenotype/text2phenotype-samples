				<p><b>CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST AND CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST</b></p>
<p><b>REASON FOR EXAM: </b> Evaluate for retroperitoneal hematoma, the patient has been following, is currently on Coumadin.</p>

<p>The liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas are unremarkable.  Within the superior pole of the left kidney, there is a 3.9 cm cystic lesion.  A 3.3 cm cystic lesion is also seen within the inferior pole of the left kidney.  No calcifications are noted.  The kidneys are small bilaterally.</p>
<p><b>CT PELVIS: </b> Evaluation of the bladder is limited due to the presence of a Foley catheter, the bladder is nondistended.  The large and small bowels are normal in course and caliber.  There is no obstruction.</p>
<p>Bibasilar pleural effusions are noted.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION:</b><br />1. No evidence for retroperitoneal bleed.<br />2. There are two left-sided cystic lesions within the kidney, correlation with a postcontrast study versus further characterization with an ultrasound is advised as the cystic lesions appear slightly larger as compared to the prior exam.<br />3. The kidneys are small in size bilaterally.<br />4. Bibasilar pleural effusions.</p>
