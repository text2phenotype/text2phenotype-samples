				<p><b>CHIEF COMPLAINT: </b> &quot;A lot has been thrown at me.&quot;</p>
<p>The patient is interviewed with husband in room.</p>
<p><b>HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: </b> This is a 69-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of Huntington disease, who presented to Hospital four days ago after an overdose of about 30 Haldol tablets 5 mg each and Tylenol tablet 325 mg each, 40 tablets.  She has been on the medical floor for monitoring and is medically stable and was transferred to the psychiatric floor today.  The patient states she had been thinking about suicide for a couple of weeks.  Felt that her Huntington disease had worsened and she wanted to spare her family and husband from trouble.  Reports she has been not socializing with her family because of her worsening depression.  Husband notes that on Monday after speaking to Dr. X, they had been advised to alternate the patient&#8217;s Pamelor (nortriptyline) to every other day because the patient was reporting dry mouth.  They did as they have instructed and husband feels this may have had some factor on her worsening depression.  The patient decided to ingest the pills when her husband went to work on Friday.  She thought Friday would be a good day because there would be less medical people working so her chances of receiving medical care would be lessened.  Her husband left around 7 in the morning and returned around 11 and found her sleeping.  About 30 minutes after his arrival, he found the empty bottles and woke up the patient to bring her to the hospital.</p>
<p>She says she wishes she would have died, but is happy she is alive and is currently not suicidal because she notes her sons may be have to be tested for the Huntington gene.  She does not clearly explain how this has made her suicidality subside.</p>
<p>This is the third suicide attempt in the last two months for this patient.  About two months ago, the patient took an overdose of Tylenol and some other medication, which the husband and the patient are not able to recall.  She was taken to Southwest Memorial Hermann Hospital.  A few weeks ago, the patient tried to shoot herself and the gun was fired and there is a blow-hole in the floor.  Husband locked the gun after that and she was taken to Bellaire Hospital.  The patient has had three psychiatric admissions in the past two months, two to Southwest Memorial and one to Bellaire Hospital for 10 days.  She sees Dr. X once or twice weekly.  He started seeing her after her first suicide attempt.</p>
<p>The patient&#8217;s husband and the patient state that until March 2009, the patient was independent, was driving herself around and was socially active.  Since then she has had worsening of her Huntington symptoms including short-term memory loss.  At present, the patient could not operate the microwave or operate her cell phone and her husband says that she is progressively more withdrawn, complains about anxiety, and complains about shortness of breath.  The patient notes that she has had depressive symptoms of quitting social life, the patient being withdrawn for the past few months and excessive worry about her Huntington disease.</p>
<p>The patient&#8217;s mother passed away 25 years ago from Huntington&#8217;s.  Her grandmother passed away 50 years ago and two brothers also passed away of Huntington&#8217;s.
