				<p><b>NAME OF PROCEDURE:</b>  Successful stenting of the left anterior descending.</p>
<p><b>DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:</b>  Angina pectoris, tight lesion in left anterior descending.</p>
<p><b>TECHNIQUE OF PROCEDURE:</b>  Standard Judkins, right groin.</p>
<p><b>CATHETERS USED: </b> 6 French Judkins, right; wire, 14 BMW; balloon for predilatation, 25 x 15 CrossSail; stent 2.5 x 18 Cypher drug-eluting stent.</p>
<p><b>ANTICOAGULATION:  </b>The patient was on aspirin and Plavix, received 3000 of heparin and was begun on Integrilin.</p>
<p><b>COMPLICATIONS: </b> None.</p>
<p><b>INFORMED CONSENT: </b> I reviewed with the patient the pros, cons, alternatives and risks of catheter and sedation exactly as I had done before during his diagnostic catheterization, plus I reviewed the risks of intervention including lack of success, need for emergency surgery, need for later restenosis and further procedures.</p>
<p><b>HEMODYNAMIC DATA: </b> The aortic pressure was in the physiologic range.</p>
<p><b>ANGIOGRAPHIC DATA: </b> Left coronary artery:  The left main coronary artery showed insignificant disease.  The left anterior descending showed fairly extensive calcification.  There was 90% stenosis in the proximal to midportion of the vessel.  Insignificant disease in the circumflex.</p>
<p><b>SUCCESSFUL STENTING: </b> A wire crossed the lesion.  We first predilated with a balloon, then advanced, deployed and post dilated the stent.  Final angiography showed 0% stenosis, no tears or thrombi, excellent intimal appearance.</p>
<p><b>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</b><br />VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 160/88, temperature 98.6, pulse 83, respirations 30.  He is saturating at 96% on 4 L nonrebreather.<br />GENERAL:  The patient is a 74 year-old white male who is cooperative with the examination and alert and oriented x3.  The patient cannot speak and communicates through writing.<br />HEENT:  Very small moles on face.  However, pupils equal, round and regular and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx is moist.<br />NECK:  Supple.  Tracheostomy site is clean without blood or discharge.<br />HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No gallop, murmur or rub.<br />CHEST:  Respirations congested.  Mild crackles in the left lower quadrant and left lower base.<br />ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender and nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.<br />EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.<br />NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact.  No focal deficit.<br />GENITALIA:  The patient does have a right scrotal swelling, very much larger than the other side, not reproducible and mobile to touch.</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSIONS</b><br />1. Successful stenting of the left anterior descending.  Initially, there was 90% stenosis.  After stenting with a drug-eluting stent, there was 0% residual.<br />2. Insignificant disease in the other coronaries.</p>
<p><b>PLAN:</b>  The patient will be treated with aspirin, Plavix, Integrilin, beta blockers and statins.  I have discussed this with him, and I have answered his questions.</p>
