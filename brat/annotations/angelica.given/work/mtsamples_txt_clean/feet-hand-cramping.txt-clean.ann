gentleman who presents for further evaluation of feet and hand cramps. He
states that for the past six months he has experienced cramps in his feet and
hands. He describes that the foot cramps are much more notable than the hand
ones. He reports that he develops muscle contractions of his toes on both
feet. These occur exclusively at night. They may occur about three times per
week. When he develops these cramps, he stands up to relieve the discomfort.
He notices that the toes are in an extended position. He steps on the ground
and they seem to  "pop into place." He develops calf pain after he experiences
the cramp. Sometimes they awaken him from his sleep.

He also has developed cramps in his hands although they are less severe and
less frequent than those in his legs. These do not occur at night and are
completely random. He notices that his thumb assumes a flexed position and
sometimes he needs to pry it open to relieve the cramp.

He has never had any symptoms like this in the past. He started taking Bactrim
about nine months ago. He had taken this in the past briefly, but has never
taken it as long as he has now. He cannot think of any other possible
contributing factors to his symptoms.

He has a history of HIV for 21 years. He was taking antiretroviral
medications, but stopped about six or seven years ago. He reports that he was
unable to tolerate the medications due to severe stomach upset. He has a CD4
count
