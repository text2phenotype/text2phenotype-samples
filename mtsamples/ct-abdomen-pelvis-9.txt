				<p><b>CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST AND CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST</b></p>
<p><b>REASON FOR EXAM: </b> Generalized abdominal pain with swelling at the site of the ileostomy.</p>
<p><b>TECHNIQUE:</b>  Axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained utilizing 100 mL of Isovue-300.</p>
<p><b>CT ABDOMEN:  </b>The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.  Punctate calcifications in the gallbladder lumen likely represent a gallstone.</p>
<p><b>CT PELVIS:  </b>Postsurgical changes of a left lower quadrant ileostomy are again seen.  There is no evidence for an obstruction.  A partial colectomy and diverting ileostomy is seen within the right lower quadrant.  The previously seen 3.4 cm subcutaneous fluid collection has resolved.  Within the left lower quadrant, a 3.4 cm x 2.5 cm loculated fluid collection has not significantly changed.  This is adjacent to the anastomosis site and a pelvic abscess cannot be excluded.  No obstruction is seen.  The appendix is not clearly visualized.  The urinary bladder is unremarkable.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION:</b><br />1.  Resolution of the previously seen subcutaneous fluid collection.<br />2.  Left pelvic 3.4 cm fluid collection has not significantly changed in size or appearance.  These findings may be due to a pelvic abscess.<br />3.  Right lower quadrant ileostomy has not significantly changed.<br />4.  Cholelithiasis.</p>
