Patient summary :
A *********** woman came to our gynecologic oncology clinic because of
persistent urinary incontinence. In ****, she had a transurethral resection of a
superficial low grade bladder cancer with no evidence of recurrent disease. In
****, she noticed an exacerbation of urinary incontinence despite tolterodine
taken as needed for symptom control. At that time, a pelvic examination
revealed a 12 week of gestation. The uterus was mobile and nontender and
these features were thought to be consistent with a fibroid. The adnexa were
difficult to assess because of the enlarged uterus. Pelvic ultrasonography was
performed favoring the diagnosis of a fibroid with cystic changes and the
patient was referred for pelvic-floor physical therapy. Three months later, in
****, a new pelvic exam identified a uterus of a pregnant woman at 16 weeks
of gestation. A second pelvic ultrasound was performed. A slight enlargement
of the fibroid was noticed with cystic lesion thought to represent cystic
degeneration. A CT scan confirmed the same size of the mass seen on
ultrasound: (7.1 cm x 7.4 cm x 7.4 cm). Patient remained stable with an
ultrasound performed every 3 months. On **********, the mass had
increased in size (6.9 cm x 8.8 cm x 10.3 cm) with large central cystic
component and a 4mm endometrial echo-complex. Given this patient's age
and the presence of a degenerating mass that increased in size on imaging
studies, the most likely diagnosis is uterine leiomyosarcoma. Based on exam
and imaging studies, a laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy was performed.

Radiology exams;
Previous Radiology exams:
**********
1. Pelvic ultrasound imaging
The uterus measures 8.5 cm x 8.9 cm x 9.6 cm. A heterogeneous mass
(measuring 6.4 cm x 7.8 cm x 8.4 cm) is identified in the uterus. There
are multiple small areas of hypoechogenicity in the mass that are most
likely consistent with cystic changes or necrosis. The mass has some
areas of increased peripheral vascularity. The endometrial echocomplex
is not well visualized because of distortion by the mass, but the
visualized portion measures 6 mm. The ovaries are not identified, but
there are no large adnexal masses.
(Upload slides 9, 10, 11)
**********
2. Pelvic ultrasound imaging:
The uterus measures 8.9 cm by 9.2 cm by 11.2 cm and has heterogeneous
echogenicity. A large fibroid (measuring 7.2 cm x 7.6 cm x 8.0 cm) is
present on the left side of the uterus, and it has areas of internal
hypoechogenicity that are probably consistent with fluid.
(Upload slide 12)
**********
3. Pelvic Ultrasound imaging:
The uterus presents with a fibroid (measuring 5.6 cm x 6.5 cm x 6.7 cm)
on the left side of the uterus that has internal cystic spaces. The fibroid
has decreased in overall size since the previous study but has a higher
number of cystic components, and it is probably consistent with a large
degenerating fibroid.

4. Pelvic Ultrasound *******:
Reveals a hypoechoic lesion (measuring 5.2 cm x 5.4 cm x 5.8 cm) that
probably represents a uterine fibroid.

********** (Most recent)
5. Pelvic Ultrasound imaging:
Coronal and sagittal gray-scale ultrasound images show a large,
heterogeneous mass (measuring 6.9 cm x 8.8 cm x 10.3 cm) in the
uterus. The mass has focal hypoechoic areas that are suggestive of
cystic changes or necrosis.

New Patient.
***** of discussion:
CJ, a *********** postmenopausal woman, has been newly diagnosed with a
high grade, FIGO **, uterine leiomyosarcoma. Today we are discussing her
case for further treatment recommendations.
Patient summary:
** had an uneventful recovery from a minimally invasive surgery. The
diagnosed leiomeiosarcoma being limited to the uterus and knowing that the
role of lymphadenectomy is controversial in this type of tumor, no further
interventions is required. Also, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy being poorly
defined for stage I disease, no adjuvant therapy will be administered. However,
the postop PET/CT scan shows a suspicious 1-cm right upper lobe lung nodule.
Next steps:
1. Consultation with thoracic surgery to observe
2. Patient will be seen in 3 months unless needed earlier.
