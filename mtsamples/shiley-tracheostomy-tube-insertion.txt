<p><b>OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: </b> After obtaining informed consent from the patient&#8217;s family, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.</p>
<p>Next, a #10-blade scalpel was used to make an incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the sternal notch.  Dissection was carried down using Bovie electrocautery to the level of the trachea.  The 2nd tracheal ring was identified.  Next, a #11-blade scalpel was used to make a trap door in the trachea.  The endotracheal tube was backed out.
