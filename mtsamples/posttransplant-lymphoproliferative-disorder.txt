				<p><b>CHIEF COMPLAINT: </b> The patient is here for followup visit and chemotherapy.</p>
<p><b>DIAGNOSES:</b><br />1.  Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.<br />2.  Chronic renal insufficiency.<br />3.  Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.<br />4.  Anemia secondary to chronic renal insufficiency and chemotherapy.<br />5.  Hypertension.</p>
<p><b>HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: </b> A 51-year-old white male diagnosed with PTLD in latter half of 2007.  He presented with symptoms of increasing adenopathy, abdominal pain, weight loss, and anorexia.  He did not seek medical attention immediately.  He was finally hospitalized by the renal transplant service and underwent a lymph node biopsy in the groin, which showed diagnosis of large cell lymphoma.  He was discussed at the hematopathology conference.  Chemotherapy with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone was started.  First cycle of chemotherapy was complicated by sepsis despite growth factor support.  He also appeared to have become disoriented either secondary to sepsis or steroid therapy.</p>
<p>The patient has received 5 cycles of chemotherapy to date.  He did not keep his appointment for a PET scan after 3 cycles because he was not feeling well.  His therapy has been interrupted for infection related to squamous cell cancer, skin surgery as well as complaints of chest infection.</p>
<p>The patient is here for the sixth and final cycle of chemotherapy.  He states he feels well.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain or fatigue.  He denies any tingling or numbness in his fingers.  Review of systems is otherwise entirely negative.</p>
<p>Performance status on the ECOG scale is 1.</p>
<p><b>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:</b><br />VITAL SIGNS:  He is afebrile.  Blood pressure 161/80, pulse 65, weight 71.5 kg, which is essentially unchanged from his prior visit.  There is mild pallor noted.  There is no icterus, adenopathy or petechiae noted.  CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  S1 and S2 normal with regular rate and rhythm.  Systolic flow murmur is best heard in the pulmonary area.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with no organomegaly.  Renal transplant is noted in the right lower quadrant with a scar present.  EXTREMITIES:  Reveal no edema.</p>
<p><b>LABORATORY DATA: </b> CBC from today shows white count of 9.6 with a normal differential, ANC of 7400, hemoglobin 8.9, hematocrit 26.5 with an MCV of 109, and platelet count of 220,000.</p>
<p><b>ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:</b><br />1.  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma following transplantation.  The patient is to receive his sixth and final cycle of chemotherapy today.  PET scan has been ordered to be done within 2 weeks.  He will see me back for the visit in 3 weeks with CBC, CMP, and LDH.<br />2.  Chronic renal insufficiency.<br />3.  Anemia secondary to chronic renal failure and chemotherapy.  He is to continue on his regimen of growth factor support.<br />4.  Hypertension.  This is elevated today because he held his meds because he is getting rituximab other than that this is well controlled.  His CMP is pending from today.<br />5.  Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.  The scalp is well healed.  He still has an open wound on the right posterior aspect of his trunk.  This has no active drainage, but it is yet to heal.  This probably will heal by secondary intention once chemotherapy is finished.  Prescription for prednisone as part of his chemotherapy has been given to him.</p>
