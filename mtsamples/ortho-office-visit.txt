				<p>The patient was evaluated today in follow up evaluation.  She continues to suffer from ongoing neck and lower back pain with no recent radicular complaints.</p>
<p>Her evaluation today reveals restriction in the range of motion of the cervical and lumbar region with tenderness and spasms of the paraspinal musculature.  Motor strength was 5/5 on the MRC scale.  Reflexes were 2+ and symmetrical.  Palpable trigger points were noted bilaterally in the trapezius and lumbar paraspinal musculature bilaterally.</p>
<p>Palpable trigger points were noted on today&#8217;s evaluation.  She is suffering from ongoing myofascitis.  Her treatment plan will consist of a series of trigger point injections, which were performed today.  She tolerated the procedure well.  I have asked her to ice the region intermittently for 15 minutes off and on x 3.  She will be followed in four weeks&#8217; time for repeat trigger point injections if indicated.</p>
