				<p><b>INDICATIONS:  </b>Chest pain.</p>
<p><b>STRESS TECHNIQUE:</b>   The patient exercised for 5.0 minutes to a heart rate of 133.  ECG was normal.  Patient achieved 7.0 METS.</p>
<p><b>IMAGE TECHNIQUE:</b>  The patient was injected with 4.2 millicuries of thallous chloride and subsequently imaged on the gated tomographic SPECT system.</p>
<p><b>IMAGE ANALYSIS:</b>  There is normal LV myocardial perfusion.  The LV systolic ejection fraction is normal at 79%.  There is normal global and regional wall motion of the left ventricle.</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br />1.  Normal ECG stress.<br />2.  Reduced aerobic capacity of 7 METS.<br />3.  Normal LV myocardial perfusion.<br />4.  Normal LV systolic ejection fraction of 79%.<br />5.  Normal global and regional wall motion of the left ventricle.</p>
