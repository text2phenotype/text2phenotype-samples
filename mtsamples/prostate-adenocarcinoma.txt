<p><b>PLAN: </b> The patient&#8217;s wife and I have discussed his treatment options, which include primarily radiation and surgery.  He has _________ surviving prostate cancer by Dr. Y.  He is aware of incontinency, both total and partial.  We discussed erectile dysfunction.  We have discussed bleeding, infection, injury to the rectum, injury to vessels and nerves, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, MI, stroke, and death.  He had no questions at the conclusion of the conversation and he does know that in his age group, though a nerve-sparing procedure will be performed, preserving any erectile function is highly unlikely.  He had no questions at the conclusion of our last conversation.</p>
