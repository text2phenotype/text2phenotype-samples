				<p><b>HISTORY:</b>  Smoking history zero.</p>
<p><b>INDICATION: </b> Dyspnea with walking less than 100 yards.</p>
<p><b>PROCEDURE:</b>  FVC was 59%.  FEV1 was 61%.  FEV1/FVC ratio was 72%. The predicted was 70%.  The FEF 25/75% was 45%, improved from 1.41 to 2.04 with bronchodilator, which represents a 45% improvement.  SVC was 69%. Inspiratory capacity was 71%.  Expiratory residual volume was 61%.  The TGV was 94%.  Residual volume was 113% of its predicted.  Total lung capacity was 83%.  Diffusion capacity was diminished.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION:</b><br />1.  Moderate restrictive lung disease.<br />2.  Some reversible small airway obstruction with improvement with bronchodilator.<br />3.  Diffusion capacity is diminished, which might indicate extrapulmonary restrictive lung disease.<br />4.  Flow volume loop was consistent with the above and no upper airway obstruction.</p>
