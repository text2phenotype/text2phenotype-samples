				<p><b>HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:</b>  In 2002, the patient had a blood test during her routine screening, which revealed anemia and an elevated creatinine.  Two weeks later she saw a nephrologist at ABCDE were she worked at that time.  An ultrasound revealed that she had Parenchymal disease in which tissue around the kidney is diseased.  No particular treatment was advised.  She was laid off 6 months later.  In 2004, she began working at The ABCD Hospital and began seeing Dr. A.  She was put on Procrit, but could not keep the stringent appointment scheduled for the injection because of her work.  She began seeing Dr. B and was put on Procrit and Renagel.
