				<p><b>PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: </b> Postmenopausal bleeding.</p>
<p><b>POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: </b> Same.</p>
<p><b>OPERATION PERFORMED:  </b>Fractional dilatation and curettage.</p>
<p><b>SPECIMENS: </b> Endocervical curettings, endometrial curettings.</p>
<p><b>INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: </b> The patient recently presented with postmenopausal bleeding.  An office endometrial biopsy was unable to be performed secondary to a stenotic internal cervical os.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS: </b> Examination under anesthesia revealed a retroverted, retroflexed uterus with fundal diameter of 6.5 cm.  The uterine cavity was smooth upon curettage.  Curettings were fairly copious.  Sounding depth was 8 cm.</p>
<p><b>PROCEDURE:</b>  The patient was brought to the Operating Room with an IV in place.  The patient was given a general anesthetic and was placed in the lithotomy position.  Examination under anesthesia was completed with findings as noted.  She was prepped and draped and a speculum was placed into the vagina.  </p>
<p>Tenaculum was placed on the cervix.  The endocervical canal was curetted using a Kevorkian curette, and the sound was used to measure the overall depth of the uterus.  The endocervical canal was dilated without difficulty to a size 16 French dilator.  A small, sharp curette was passed into the uterine cavity and curettings were obtained.</p>
<p>After completion of the curettage, polyp forceps were passed into the uterine cavity.  No additional tissue was obtained.  Upon completion of the dilatation and curettage, minimum blood loss was noted.</p>
<p>The patient was awakened from her anesthetic, and taken to the post anesthesia care unit in stable condition.</p>
