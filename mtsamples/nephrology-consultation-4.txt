<p><b>IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  </b>The patient is admitted with a diagnosis of acute on chronic renal insufficiency, rule out hepatorenal insufficiency could be secondary to congestive heart failure, cardiac cirrhosis, rule out possibility of ascites secondary to mesothelioma because the patient has got history of exposure to asbestos and has got pulmonary nodule, rule out diabetic nephropathy could be secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis.  The patient has hematuria could be secondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy, rule out malignancy.  We will do urine for cytology.  We will do a renal ultrasound, and 24-hour urine collection for protein/creatinine, creatinine clearance, immunofixation, serum electrophoresis, serum uric acid, serum iron, TIBC, and serum ferritin levels.  We will send a PSA level and if needed may be a urology consult.</p>
