The colonoscope was slowly withdrawn and a careful examination of the colonic mucosa was made, including a retroflexed view of the rectum.  There was a 4 mm descending colon polyp, which was removed with jumbo forceps, and sent for histology in bottle one.  There was a 10 mm pale, flat polyp in the distal rectum, which was removed with jumbo forceps, and sent for histology in bottle 2.  There were small internal hemorrhoids.  The remainder of the examination was normal to the cecum.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.</p>
