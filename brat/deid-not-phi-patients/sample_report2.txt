Therapies associated with potential benefit or lack of benefit are based on biomarker results and published medical evidence derived from multiple tumor types. The selection of any,
all, or none of the matched therapies resides solely with the discretion of the treating physician. Decisions on patient care and treatment must be based on the independent medical
judgment of the treating physician, taking into consideration all available information concerning the patient's condition in accordance with the applicable standard of care.

Drugs are placed in the Uncertain benefit category when a result suggests only a decreased likelihood of response (vs. little to no likelihood
of response) or if there is insufficient evidence to associate the drug with either benefit or lack of benefit. Refer to the Appendix for detailed
Result and Value information for each biomarker, including appropriate cutoffs, unit of measure, etc.
