New Patient
PV
***** of discussion:
A ******* old patient recently diagnosed with a cervical adenosquamous
carcinoma (grade 2 out of 3), FIGO IB2 is being presented today to discuss
further management of her disease.
Patient summary:
A 28 y/o patient presents to our department with a 36.5 weeks
pregnancy and a friable cervical mass of more than 4cm highly
suspicious for malignancy. The patient was seen earlier at her hospital
but denied any treatment and favored to pursue her pregancy. A
concomitant cesarean delivery and immediate type lll radical
hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy were planned and
performed in this patient. The estimated blood loss was ****.
Baby and mother did well and were discharged postop day #4.
Rational for the recommendations:
Patient had:
• Deep stromal invasion, ***** mm
Tumor size of 4.5 cm
• Positive lymphovascular invasion
Recommandations
• Offered enrollment on GOG 263, RT+ chemo, declined (too anxious
about chemotherapy)
• Recommended to receive adjuvant radiation
Patient was offered counseling about radiation therapy long term toxicity
o Vaginal stenosis, dilator can prevent
o Pelvic insufficiency fracture, (~10%)
o Damage to bowel or bladder, (<5%)
o Radiation induced malignancy(<1%)
Next steps:
•
Patient will receive adjuvan radiation therapy whole pelvic radiation to
** Gy using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) at an outside
institution.
Patient will be seen at 4 and 8 months after completion of the radiation
therapy unless if needed earlier.
PAP smear to be performed every 6 months
