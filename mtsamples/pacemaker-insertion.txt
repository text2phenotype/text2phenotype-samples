<p><b>PROCEDURE AND GROSS FINDINGS:</b> The patient&#8217;s chest was prepped with Betadine solution and a small amount of Lidocaine infiltrated.  In the left subclavian region, a subclavian stick was performed without difficulty, and a wire was inserted. Fluoroscopy confirmed the presence of the wire in the superior vena cava.  An introducer was then placed over the wire.  The wire was removed and replace by a ventricular lead that was seated under Fluoroscopy. Following calibration, the lead was attached to a pacemaker generator that was inserted in a subcutaneous pocket in the left subclavian area.  </p>
<p>The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated and closed with Interrupted 4-O Vicryl, and the skin was closed with staples.  Sterile dressings were placed, and the patient was returned to the ICU in good condition.</p>
