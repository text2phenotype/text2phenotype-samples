				<p><b>INDICATIONS:</b>  Atrial fibrillation, coronary disease.</p>
<p><b>STRESS TECHNIQUE:</b> The patient was infused with dobutamine to a maximum heart rate of 142.  ECG exhibits atrial fibrillation.</p>
<p><b>IMAGE TECHNIQUE:</b>  The patient was injected with 5.2 millicuries of thallous chloride and subsequently imaged on the gated tomographic SPECT system.</p>
<p><b>IMAGE ANALYSIS:</b>  It should be noted that the images are limited slightly by the patient&#8217;s obesity with a weight of 263 pounds.  There is normal LV myocardial perfusion.  The LV systolic ejection fraction is normal at 65%.  There is normal global and regional wall motion.</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br />1.  Basic rhythm of atrial fibrillation with no change during dobutamine stress, maximum heart rate of 142.<br />2.  Normal LV myocardial perfusion.<br />3.  Normal LV systolic ejection fraction of 65%.<br />4.  Normal global and regional wall motion.</p>
