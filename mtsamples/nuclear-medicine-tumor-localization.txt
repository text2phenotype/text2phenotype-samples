				<p><b>EXAM:</b>  Nuclear medicine tumor localization, whole body.</p>
<p><b>HISTORY: </b> Status post subtotal thyroidectomy for thyroid carcinoma, histology not provided.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS: </b> Following the oral administration of 4.3 mCi Iodine-131, whole body planar images were obtained in the anterior and posterior projections at 24, 48, and 72 hours.</p>
<p>There is increased uptake in the left upper quadrant, which persists throughout the examination.  There is a focus of increased activity in the right lower quadrant, which becomes readily apparent at 72 hours.  Physiologic uptake in the liver, spleen, and transverse colon is noted.  Physiologic urinary bladder uptake is also appreciated.  There is low-grade uptake in the oropharyngeal region.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION:  </b>Iodine-avid foci in the right lower quadrant and left upper quadrant medially suspicious for distant metastasis.  Anatomical evaluation, i.e., CT is advised to determine if there are corresponding mesenteric lesions.  Ultimately (provided that the original pathology of the thyroid tumor with iodine-avid) PET scanning may be necessary.  No evidence of iodine added locoregional metastasis.</p>
