				<p><b>EXAM: </b> Transesophageal echocardiogram and direct current cardioversion.</p>
<p><b>REASON FOR EXAM:  </b><br />1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.<br />2.  Shortness of breath.</p>
<p><b>PROCEDURE: </b> After informed consent was obtained, the patient was then sedated using a total of 4 mg of Versed and 50 mcg of fentanyl.  Following this, transesophageal probe was placed in the esophagus.  Transesophageal views of the heart were then obtained.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS:</b><br />1.  Left ventricle is of normal size.  Overall LV systolic function is preserved.  Estimated ejection fraction is 60% to 65%.  No wall motion abnormalities are noted.<br />2.  Left atrium is dilated.<br />3.  Left atrial appendage is free of clots.<br />4.  Right atrium is of normal size.<br />5.  Right ventricle is of normal size.<br />6.  Mitral valve shows evidence of mild MAC.<br />7.  Aortic valve is sclerotic without significant restriction of leaflet motion.<br />8.  Tricuspid valve appears normal.<br />9.  Pulmonic valve appears normal.<br />10.  Pacer wires are noted in the right atrium and in the right ventricle.<br />11.  Doppler interrogation of moderate mitral regurgitation is present.<br />12.  Mild-to-moderate AI is seen.<br />13.  No significant TR is noted.<br />14.  No significant TI is noted.<br />15.  No pericardial disease seen.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION:</b><br />1.  Preserved left ventricular systolic function.<br />2.  Dilated left atrium.<br />3.  Moderate mitral regurgitation.<br />4.  Aortic valve sclerosis with mild-to-moderate aortic insufficiency.<br />5.  Left atrial appendage is free of clots.</p>
<p>Following these, direct current cardioversion was performed.  Three biphasic shock waves of 150 and two of 200 joules were then applied to the patient&#8217;s chest in anteroposterior direction without success in conversion to sinus rhythm.  The patient remained in atrial fibrillation.</p>
<p><b>PLAN: </b> Plan will be to continue medical therapy.  We will consider using beta-blocker, calcium channel blockers for better ventricular rate control.</p>
