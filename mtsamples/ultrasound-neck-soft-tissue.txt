				<p><b>EXAM:  </b>Ultrasound neck/soft tissue, head.</p>
<p><b>HISTORY: </b> Right-sided facial swelling and draining wound.</p>
<p><b>TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:</b>  Ultrasound of the right mandibular region was performed.</p>
<p>No focal collection is identified.  This whole region appears to be phlegmonous.  It is hard to adequately delineate the exact margins of this region.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION:  </b>Abnormal appearing right mandibular region has more phlegmonous changes.  No focal fluid collection.</p>
<p>Had a discussion with Dr. xx.  Consider CT for further evaluation.</p>
