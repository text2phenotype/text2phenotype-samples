				<p><b>PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:</b>  Diarrhea, suspected irritable bowel.</p>
<p><b>POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:</b>  Normal colonoscopy.</p>
<p><b> PREMEDICATIONS: </b> Versed 5 mg, Demerol 75 mg IV.</p>
<p><b>REPORTED PROCEDURE:</b>  The rectal exam revealed no external lesions.  The prostate was normal in size and consistency.</p>
<p>The colonoscope was inserted into the cecum with ease.  The cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum were normal.  The scope was retroflexed in the rectum and no abnormality was seen, so the scope was straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated.</p>
<p><b>ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION:</b>  Normal colonoscopy &#8211; no evidence of inflammatory disease, polyp, or other neoplasm.  These findings are certainly consistent with irritable bowel syndrome.</p>
