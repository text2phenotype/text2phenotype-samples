<p><b>POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: </b> Left hemothorax rule out empyema.</p>
<p><b>PROCEDURE: </b> Insertion of a 12-French pigtail catheter in the left pleural space.</p>
<p><b>PROCEDURE DETAIL:  </b>After obtaining informed consent, the patient was taken to the minor OR in the Same Day Surgery where his posterior left chest was prepped and draped in a usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was injected and then a 12-French pigtail catheter was inserted in the medial scapular line about the eighth intercostal space.  It was difficult to draw fluid by syringe, but we connected the system to a plastic bag and by gravity started draining at least 400 mL while we were in the minor OR.  Samples were sent for culture and sensitivity, aerobic and anaerobic.</p>
<p>The patient and I decided to admit him for a period of observation at least overnight.</p>
<p>He tolerated the procedure well and the postprocedure chest x-ray showed no complications.</p>
