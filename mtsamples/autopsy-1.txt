<p><b>INTERNAL EXAMINATION &#8211; SUMMARY</b></p>
<p><b>CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM: </b>The brain weighs 1,303 grams and is within normal limits. <br /><b>SKELETAL SYSTEM:</b> Subdural hematoma and comminuted fractures of the occipital bone are observed. Numerous bone fragments from the fractures penetrated the brain tissue. <br /><b>RESPIRATORY SYSTEM&#8211;THROAT STRUCTURES: </b>The oral cavity shows no lesions. The mucosa is intact and there are no injuries to the lips, teeth or gums. There is no obstruction of the airway. The mucosa of the epiglottis, glottis, piriform sinuses, trachea and major bronchi are anatomic. No injuries are seen and there are no mucosal lesions. The lungs weigh: right, 355 grams; left 362 grams. The lungs are unremarkable. <br /><b>CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:</b> The heart weighs 253 grams, and has a normal size and configuration. No evidence of atherosclerosis is present. <br /><b>GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM: </b>The mucosa and wall of the esophagus are intact and gray-pink, without lesions or injuries. The gastric mucosa is intact and pink without injury. Approximately 125 ml of partially digested semisolid food is found in the stomach. The mucosa of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon and rectum are intact. <br /><b>URINARY SYSTEM:</b> The kidneys weigh: left, 115 grams; right, 113 grams. The kidneys are anatomic in size, shape and location and are without lesions. <br /><b>FEMALE GENITAL SYSTEM: </b>The structures are within normal limits. Examination of the pelvic area indicates the victim had not given birth and was not pregnant at the time of death. Vaginal fluid samples are removed for analysis. </p>
<p><b>DESCRIPTION OF INJURIES &#8211; SUMMARY</b></p>
<p>Blunt force traumatic injury with multiple cranial fractures resulting in craniocerebral injury. Wound measures approximately 4 inches high x 5 1/2 inches wide. Subdural hematoma and comminuted fractures of the occipital bone are observed. Numerous bone fragments from the fractures penetrated the brain tissue. Depths of penetration range from 1/2-inch to 3 inches. Injury appears to have resulted from a single blow administered to the posterior of the head, delivered at an approximate 90&ordm; angle to the occipital bone.</p>
