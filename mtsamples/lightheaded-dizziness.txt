Normal cardiac structure by echocardiogram a year and half ago.<br />3.  Normal cardiac catheterization in 11/07.<br />4.  Negative workup so far for acute cardiac event in terms of EKG, cardiac enzyme profile.</p>
<p><b>RECOMMENDATIONS:</b><br />1.  From cardiac standpoint, observation, no other investigation at this juncture.<br />2.  The patient was started on low dose of beta-blocker and see how she fares.  Fortunately, no arrhythmia documented.  If there is no documentation of arrhythmia, we will do observation.  The patient was started empirically on beta-blocker and workup on outpatient basis explained to her.  As mentioned above, she does not have any cardiac risk factors.</p>
