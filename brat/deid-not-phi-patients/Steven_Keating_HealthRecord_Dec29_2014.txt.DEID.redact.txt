            NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION
            Keating, Steven
            BWH #
            DOB 4/29/88
            DOE 10/7/14

            Identifying information/reason for referral: Steven Keating is 26-year-old R-handed man with newly diagnosed left frontal diffuse
            astrocytoma who presents for evaluation of cognitive functioning. He was referred by Dr. Patrick Wen in light of medical history
            and to establish a cognitive baseline. Today's evaluation consisted of a review of available medical records, a clinical interview,
            and the completion of a battery of neuropsychological tests. There is no history of prior neuropsychological testing. All
            background information was obtained from the patient or from the longitudinal medical record (LMR).

            History of presenting concerns: Medical history is well documented in LMR and in Dr. Wen's recent notes, which I have
            reviewed. In brief summary, Mr. Keating was a voluntary participant in an fMRI research study in December 2007, and was
            notified that there was an abnormality on his scan. A brain MRI was obtained, which demonstrated a small left inferior frontal
            T2/FLAIR hyperintensity felt to be possibly consistent with cortical dysplasia or low grade glial neoplasm. A follow-up scan in
            several years was recommended. He had a repeat brain MRI in 2010 and was told that the lesion was stable. He was then in his
            usual state of health until about one year ago, when he began to notice severe headaches after vigorous exercise. Starting in mid-
            June 2014, he began to experience frequent stereotyped episodes of 20 seconds of light-headedness and a feeling of "questioning
            my own reality," followed by about a minute of smelling a strong acidic smell, light-headedness and L>R eyelid twitching without
            convulsive movements or loss of consciousness. These spells occurred every few days, with as many as three spells in one day,
            and were followed by a dull headache for about 20 minutes. He presented to a neurologist for evaluation and was started on
            Keppra 250mg BID and referred for MRI of the brain, which demonstrated a large non-enhancing left frontal mass lesion. He
            underwent resection of this lesion on August 19, 2014 (Dr. Ennio Chiocca) with pathology consistent with a diffuse astrocytoma,
            WHO Grade II, and is now followed by Dr. Wen (DFCI Neuro-oncology) for treatment planning. On interview today, he
            reported that his primary concerns post-surgically have been significant insomnia and increased anxiety. With respect to sleep, he
            has difficulty primarily with maintenance, awakening for periods of 30-60 minutes in the early morning hours. This has improved
            slightly but remains problematic. In addition, he reported the onset of understandable anxiety symptoms since his diagnosis, which
            include thoughts running through his head, vigilance regarding physical symptoms (e.g. those that might be related to his tumor),
            and a sense of inability to "trust" his own mind due to his experience of olfactory hallucinations in the past. He finds that he does
            relatively well when distracted or around others, but experiences more acute anxiety during the nighttime hours or when alone. He
            denied symptoms of depression, describing his mood as "contemplative" rather than sad. When questioned regarding cognitive
            domains, he generally denied post-surgical changes in functioning. The sold areas endorsed included mild inattention (which he
            attributes to his ongoing anxiety and degree of preoccupation) and a slight increase in typographical errors, which has led him to
            check his emails more carefully. He noted that he experienced some paraphasic errors immediately after surgery, but this resolved
            within days.

            All aspects of ADLs are intact. He has good medication adherence and uses a pill organizer. He does not have a car and uses
            public transportation. He used a bicycle in the past and always wears a helmet. He is managing his finances with no difficulty. He
            is making efforts to exercise daily and has noted some benefit in terms of his sleep. He reported good social and family support.

                   2010: follow up MRI with stable lesion

                   Spring/summer 2013: began to notice severe headaches after vigorous exercise

                   July 2014: presented to neurologist for evaluation of 6 week history of stereotyped episodes of acidic smell, derealization,
                   light-headedness and L>R eyelid twitching. MR brain obtained, demonstrating large primarily non- enhancing left frontal
                   mass lesion

                   8/19/14: underwent resection of L frontal tumor (Dr. Ennio Chiocca). Path: Diffuse Astrocytoma, WHO Grade II

            Additional Medical History: Unremarkable. He had a loss of consciousness in high school while engaged in a breath- holding
            context and chipped a tooth, but has no concussion history. No seizure symptoms post-surgically although he occasionally has
            mild "aura-like" symptoms.


            Neuroimaging/Prior Studies: Recent MRI available in LMR; Postsurgical changes with a resection cavity in the left frontal lobe,
            with regions of T2 abnormality medial and posterior to the cavity. Mild linear enhancement along cavity most likely postsurgical.
            No evidence of enhancing, hypervascular or hypercellular tumor progression.


            Psychiatric History: There is no history of psychiatric diagnosis or treatment, no history of psychotropic medication trials, and no
            history of participation in psychotherapy.

            Relevant Family History:
            History of Meniere's disease in his mother, as well as migraines and a question of bipolar disorder (due to what may have been a
            single manic episode as well as depressive episodes per description).



            Current Medications:
            Keppra (LEVETIRACETAM) 500MG TABLET Take 1 Tablet(s) PO BID
            Tylenol Extra Strength (ACETAMINOPHEN Extra Strength) 500 MG TABLET as directed, as needed
            Melatonin
            Valerian
            Omega 3 supplement

            Social History: Mr. Keating was born and raised in Calgary, Canada and currently lives with roommates while attending MIT.
            He has been in a relationship with his girlfriend for seven months, and described this as a significant source of support. He has not
            used caffeine since his surgery, and drinks alcohol occasionally (once per week at maximum). He does not use any other
            substances.

            Educational/Occupational History: Early development was unremarkable to the best of his knowledge. He was generally an
            excellent student who earned A grades and graduated at the top of his high school class. He went on to complete a bachelor's
            degree in Mechanical Engineering and Film at Queen's University. He is currently in his fifth year of graduate study at MIT, with
            all coursework completed. He is considering whether to delay his thesis work due to his diagnosis and potential need for
            treatment. His performance has been excellent throughout grad school, with a GPA of 4.9. He holds a research assistant position
            at MIT, and is otherwise a full time student.

            Relevant Review of Systems:
            Sleep: Bedtime 11pm-12am, uses computer in bed with light filter. Sleep onset within 15-20 minutes. Awakening between 3-4
            am for 30-60 minutes, again at 6 am. Using blackout blinds. No snoring or abnormal movement reported. Possible increased
            urination at night which may contribute.
            Appetite/Weight: Recent 5 pound weight loss, eating a healthy diet.
            Sensory functioning: Increased sensitivity to sound and decreased olfactory acuity post-surgically. Scalp numbness, cold hands
            and feet.

            Recommendation/plan: As a result of this diagnostic evaluation, it is recommended that Mr. Keating proceed to
            neuropsychological testing to include a comprehensive battery of tests of cognitive function, mood, and personality. He
            understands and is in agreement with this plan. He is motivated and fully capable of participating in the evaluation process.




            Behavioral Observations during Testing:
            Mr. Keating was alert, engaged, and easily established rapport with the examiners. He expressed interest in the testing process
            and was highly motivated. Comprehension was intact for all task instructions and he worked independently without need for

            prompting or redirection. He asked appropriate questions about the tasks when he required additional clarity. He occasionally
            provided more complex responses than required on less structured tasks. He showed an appropriate range of emotional
            expression and intact frustration tolerance. He occasionally appeared disappointed in his performance or mild anxious, but this
            did not significantly affect his ability to engage in the presented tasks. He was slightly restless at times (e.g. shifting in his seat) and
            showed some evidence of fatigue (yawning, mild inattention) toward the end of the lengthy testing session. However, he
            continued to put forth excellent effort and the presented results can be considered a valid estimate of his current cognitive
            functioning.

            Summary of Test Results (please also see attached table):

            Baseline intellectual functioning was estimated to fall within the superior range, and performance on selected verbal and visual
            intellectual tasks were superior and consistent with this estimate. Specific subtest performances are discussed further below.

            Basic auditory attention and working memory were consistently within the average range, with spans of 7 digits repeated, 5 digits
            backward, and 6 digits (variably) sequenced. This represents a mild weakness relative to Mr. Keating's superior level of
            intellectual functioning. Processing speed on a digit-symbol coding task with demands on divided visual attention and working
            memory was high average. Speed was superior on paper-and-pencil tasks of visual scanning and number and letter sequencing,
            and speed remained above average when cognitive set-shifting demands were introduced (letter-number sequencing). All of the
            above tasks were performed without error. Activation and sustained retrieval were superior and very superior (respectively) on
            timed verbal fluency tasks requiring generation of words in response to phonemic (first letter) and semantic (category) prompts.
            When cognitive flexibility demands were increased (generation of responses from alternating semantic categories), speed of
            generation remained in the superior range. He made a slightly elevated number of repetition errors, but this was in the context of a
            very high number of total responses. Verbally-mediated processing speed on timed word reading and color naming tasks was
            average to high average. Speed remained high average when response inhibition demands were introduced (color-word
            condition) on a subsequent inhibition/set-shifting condition. Accuracy was also above average with 0 errors across conditions.

            On an extended task requiring attention, sustained concentration, vigilance, and response inhibition performance was within
            normal limits, with faster than average response times, low error rate, and intact ability to adapt to changes in task demand. The
            sole area of weakness was mild loss of response consistency as the task progressed over time, but the overall results were within
            the non-clinical range, without indication of clinically significant attentional problems.

            Performance on a problem-solving task requiring spatial planning, rule learning, and maintenance of cognitive set (Tower task)
            was above average. All items were completed correctly and within the time allowed, and the majority were completed within or
            near the optimal number of moves. Mr. Keating correctly recognized when an error led to the need for a higher number or moves
            to complete a trial, and expressed some disappointment in his performance. However, his overall score was above average and
            completion speed and accuracy were well within normal limits. Abstract verbal reasoning was in the superior range, as was
            performance on a visual abstract reasoning task requiring completion of increasingly complex patterns.

            Learning and memory performances were generally high average to superior. On a list learning task, initial encoding of a 16-word
            list was average at the first of five learning trials with an intact learning curve and superior encoding for learning trials 1-5. After
            presentation of a distracter list, recall remained superior at 15/16 words, while learning of the distracter list (which is presented
            only once) was average at 6/16. After a 20-minute distraction filled delay, recall for the original list was high average (14/16), and
            improved to 15/16 with category cues. Recognition discrimination was intact (high average range) and error free. Recall for
            contextual verbal material (detailed short stories) was high average immediately following presentation and remained high average
            after 25-minute delay, 100% retention over time. Recognition discrimination for story details was intact within normal limits.
            Visual memory for briefly presented geometric designs was high average immediately following presentation, and superior after
            25-minute delay with 98% percent retention over time. Recognition discrimination was error-free. Incidental recall of a
            previously copied complex figure was average after brief distraction, and remained average after 20-minute delay, with 100%
            retention. Mr. Keating showed good recall of the overall figure gestalt and major components, with some loss of internal detail at
            the level of initial encoding. However, as shown by his percent retention, information storage over time was entirely intact.

            Language was entirely within normal limits with regard to comprehension, repetition, and word reading. Narrative writing was
            legible, well-composed, free from errors, and accurately described character roles and other relevant aspects of a visual scene.
            Performance on a confrontation naming task was within normal limits.

            Visuospatial functions were entirely intact. There was no evidence of difficulty with visual perception, and visual construction on a
            complex figure copy task was in the superior range. He produced a highly precise and error-free copy. As mentioned above,
            performance on a visual pattern completion task was also in the superior range.

            Fine motor speed and dexterity were high average bilaterally, with a typical dominant hand advantage. Basic graphomotor speed
            on a line tracing task (dominant hand) was in the superior range.

            Responses to self-report inventories indicated minimal depressive symptoms, and fell below the cut-off for symptoms of worry
            typically associated with generalized anxiety.

            Impressions and Recommendations: In summary, Mr. Keating is a 26-year-old man with a history of recently diagnosed left
            frontal astrocytoma referred for evaluation by his neuro-oncologist. Results of today's evaluation describe him as a man of
            superior estimated premorbid functioning who demonstrates mild relative weaknesses in attention and working memory. A very
            mild was also noted in single-trial learning and initial encoding of information with high organizational demands, which is likely
            reciprocally related to attentional functioning. However, it is important to emphasize that these scores were still within normal
            limits for age and education, and represent areas of weakness only in relation to superior range functioning in other areas. Mr.
            Keating's cognitive profile is primarily one of strengths, with above average to superior scores across domains and across most
            administered tasks today, consistent with his estimated premorbid abilities. He has also demonstrated considerable emotional
            resilience in response to this significant health challenge. He is experiencing understandable anxiety that appears to be
            circumstantial/situational rather than representing a primary anxiety disorder. However, these symptoms are causing him distress
            and potentially interfering with sleep. In terms of etiology of mild cognitive weaknesses, anxiety symptoms are likely to be
            contributory, and weaknesses in attention and working memory can also be associated with disrupted sleep. In addition, his
            frontally located tumor and associated disruption of frontal-subcortical networks may be contributory as well. Again, however,
            these weaknesses were mild in nature and occur in the context of multiple areas of cognitive strength, suggesting that Mr. Keating
            is functioning at or near his baseline level. He is motivated to address and improve his anxiety symptoms and sleep, and this will
            likely have a beneficial impact on attention and concentration in daily life. The following recommendations are provided:

                     1) There are several available DFCI resources that may be extremely helpful to Mr. Keating. Consultation with
                     psychosocial oncology is a recommended initial first step, for additional evaluation of and input regarding anxiety
                     symptoms. Mr. Keating indicated a preference for non-pharmacological treatments today, and a referral to the Young
                     Adult Program (http://dana-farber-yap.org/) and Karen Fasciano, PsyD, is also recommended. Mr. Keating is insightful
                     and motivated and will be an excellent candidate for cognitive-behavioral treatment of anxiety symptoms, as well as
                     benefitting from additional support and normalization of his experience. Complementary approaches to stress
                     management may also be a useful addition to Mr. Keating's treatment. Services in this area are available through the
                     DFCI Zakim Center                       Mindfulness-based meditation and stress reduction practices are also
                     recommended. In addition to benefits for stress and anxiety, these techniques have also been associated with
                     improvement in aspects of cognitive function such as attention and working memory. Recommended resources include
                     the UMass Medical School Center for Mindfulness website (www.umassmed.edu/cfm), " Mindfulness for Beginners" by
                     Jon Kabat Zinn, and the book "The Mindful Way Through Anxiety" by Orsillo and Roemer.

                     2) Continued work to improve and consolidate sleep will be helpful for mood and cognition. Mr. Keating was
                     encouraged to try a week-long behavioral experiment and eliminate computer use in bed. He will also continue to benefit
                     from daily physical exercise and the use of good environmental sleep strategies (which he has implemented
                     independently). If insomnia symptoms do not improve, he may also wish to consider beginning a bed time relation
                     routine. This can take many forms and he should determine which is the best fit for him. Approaches include mediation,
                     using a guided imagery or relaxation protocol (for example, see free downloads available through MITMedical at
                     http://medweb.mit.edu/wellness/resources/downloads.html), and using a journal to write and record worries, tasks, and
                     other aspects of the day that may be interfering with relaxation. " Externalizing" these factors by acknowledging and
                     writing them down can help to calm anxious thoughts. For additional strategies, resources such as " The Insomnia
                     Workbook" by Stephanie Silberman can be helpful. In addition, there are psychologists with specialized expertise in
                     cognitive behavioral treatment of insomnia, including Lisa Strauss, PhD (                    and Claudia Toth, PsyD (
                                  Dana-Farber also offers the "Sleep 8 Feel Great" program beginning in January. Call                    , or

            Steven Keating
            MRN#

            Mr Keating, with his parents and girlfriend, were seen in clinic today for suture removal. His suture line was clean, dry and intact without signs of
            infection. We discussed post suture care, including keeping the site open to air and keeping it dry for another 24 hours. He was instructed to call
            the clinic for tempuature greater than 101.5, any drainage or reddness.

            We discussed that his pathology was still pending and that I would notify him with the pathology once it is available. We also
            discussed that he wil be followed by Dr. Wen at DFCI for which he already has an appointment in early September.

            He has a good understanding of the above instructions.

            Dear Dr. Firn,

            I am seeing today in followup, Mr. Keating. He decided to undergo surgery. We had a functional MRI showing that his speech
            area has been pushed by the tumor from its usual location. We discussed with him the risks and complications of the surgery.
             We will plan to do this with him awake to monitor speech, and also within the Amigo intraoperative MRI suite. I will obtain a
            CT angiogram to confirm the lenticulo striate vessels are pushed away from the tumor.

            All his questions were answered, as well as questions related to the disposition of his tissues for research and other genetic testing.

            Sincerely,

            Dear Dr. Firn,

            This is a 26-year-old right-handed white male who used to live in Canada. In 2007, he participated in a functional MRI research
            study. At that time, he was called back saying that this was a lesion in his left frontal area. He was told that this lesion could be
            followed because it was small. Over the years, he has had serial MRI scans, the last one in Canada in October 2010 did not
            show growth of the lesion. He was then lost to follow up. However, in the last week, he developed the equivalent of a seizure-
            like activity. This has involved lightheadedness, deja vu type feelings, smells, and left eye twitching. He had no loss of
            consciousness. These episodes were followed by dull headaches. He was started on Keppra and then on MRI scan was
            performed. This showed a large left frontal and insular lesion. He comes in today for followup. They obtained my name from a
            neurosurgeon that knows his PhD advisor. He otherwise has had no speech issues. He had no memory issues.

            MEDICATIONS: He is currently taking Keppra 50 mg p.o. twice a day.

            FAMILY HISTORY: There is no family history of brain disease of brain cancer.

            SOCIAL HISTORY: He does not use of tobacco. He is currently a PhD student and works on 3D printing. He occasionally
            drinks. He is here not only with his PhD advisor, but also with his parents and other relatives.

            PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, he is completely awake and alert. There are no focal neurological symptoms
            or signs that I can tell.

            IMAGING: His MRI scan shows a large left frontal and insular lesion that involves the operculum in the front where it seems to
            be involving Broca's area. There is a little bit of the tumor in the left anterior temporal lobe as well. The tumor is T2 and FLAIR
            hyperintense. It does put pressure with some left and right shift of the brain, particularly anteriorly.

            ASSESSSMENT AND PLAN: I had a long discussion with the patient. This is likely a low-grade glioma. We discussed
            potential approaches. I think we should proceed with a functional MRI as well as a 2HG MRI scan. The functional MRI would
            be for presurgical planning to distinguish where Broca's area is. Based on this, it would be helpful to also figure out if the
            functional MRI showed that his speech is totally on the left side, which is what I expect. We will also get a CT angiogram to see
            where the lenticulostriate vessels are. The plan will be for him to proceed with an attempted gross total resection of the lesion.
             This could be done with the patient awake and also potentially in the intraoperative MRI suite.

            I did discuss some of the risks and complications from the surgery as well. I did tell him that after the functional MRI scan and a
            CT angiogram, we should meet again at least 1 more time to go over the potential risks. They want to think about their options.
             They also have a consultation pending or they have already obtained this yesterday from Massachusetts General Hospital. I have
            told him that either place will be well suited for this operation.

Date of Operation:             08/19/14                        Report Status:      Signed

SURGEON: CHIOCCA, ENNIO MD


ASSISTANT:
Peleg Horowitz, MD

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left frontal insular glioma.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left frontal insular glioma.

OPERATION:
1. Awake left frontotemporal craniotomy for resection of
low-grade glioma (Extensive approach and dissection).
2. Use of intraoperative MRI.
3. Computer assisted stereotactic navigation with the BrainLAB
device.
4. Use of microscope.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Less than 100 mL.

SPECIMEN REMOVED:
Left frontal and insular low-grade glioma.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
This is a 27-year-old student who is a student at MIT. Several
years ago, he a low-grade glioma diagnosed by MRI scan, which has
been followed. The last scan was in 2010. A few weeks ago, he had
a seizure and an MRI scan was performed revealing that this tumor
has enlarged considerably and this time it involves most of his
left frontal lobe, most of his left insula and is generating left to
right subfalcine herniation. A functional MRI was performed
showing that his speech/Broca's area was displaced superiorly,
but there is also speech in the superior temporal gyrus right
inferior to the insula as expected. He is brought to surgery for
resection of tumor.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought down to
the operating room (AMIGO suite). After the provision of MAC anesthesia, we
proceeded to anesthetize areas in his scalp. We provided to perform both a
scalp block as well as anesthesia in 3 areas for the pins. This allowed us to
fixate his head in a Mayfield cranial pin apparatus. We then
proceeded to pin his head onto the Mayfield. His head was
slightly turned with the left side up. We then made sure that
all of his body parts were well padded and then we proceeded to
obtain BrainLAB coordinates. After obtaining the BrainLAB
coordinates, we proceeded to prep and drape the left side of his
scalp in usual sterile fashion. We then proceeded to anesthesize the
area of incision, and then proceeded to make a left frontotemporal
incision. We turned the scalp flap over a roll of sponges
and a little cuff of temporalis muscles was also incised. We then
proceeded to place bur holes in the temporal area and in the frontal
area next to the keel. This allowed us to turn a frontotemporal

craniotomy. After removing the bone flap, we proceeded to bite
down from the temporal bone inferiorly as well as some of the
frontal bone next to the sphenoid wing. After removing a large
piece of sphenoid keel, we proceeded to tent the dura
circumferentially. We then proceeded to cut the dura in a
circumferential fashion. The brain appeared to be relatively
full and therefore, the patient was given mannitol and also
Lasix. Preoperatively, he was also given some Decadron. I could
see discoloration in the left frontal area in front of the pars
triangularis. We proceeded to use the electrocortical stimulator
to stimulate and to see whether there was any speech arrest and none
was obtained. I then proceeded to make a generous 5-cm
corticectomy in his left inferior frontal gyrus. Then tediously
over the course of several hours, we painstakingly proceeded to
dissect the tumor in a subpial fashion. Inferiorly, we proceeded
to dissect the tumor from the base of the frontal lobe until we
encountered the olfactory nerve and then proceeded to go further, and
then encountered the gyrus rectus and proceeded to remove tumor
from the gyrus rectus, until the midline structures were
encountered. Inferiorly, I proceeded to dissect tumor off of the
sylvian fissure until we proceeded to encounter the insula. I entered
the insula in between the perysilvian vessel and proceeded to dissect tumor
from this area as well. The patient was speaking well throughout
this, but on several instances, especially as I was dissecting
superiorly and close to where the corona radiata was, there were
instances in which he had more trouble with speech in terms of
speech intelligibility. I would then stop and wait for a while
and his speech would return to almost normal. However, after
several hours of doing this, he was clearly getting very tired.
By this time, I dissected the tumor and a couple very large
pieces were sent off for pathology as well as additional genetic
studies and we had the tumor dissected completely off the
anterior cranial fossa in a subpial fashion.   I
was also removing tumor anteriorly and got into the anterior temporal
lobe and proceeded to remove tumor off the anterior temporal lobe. I was able to
identify in a subpial fashion, the carotid artery, and then
proceeded to dissect the tumor all the way from the top of the ICA to the middle
cerebral artery from proximal to distal. We finally encountered the
lenticulostriate vessels denoting the medial-inferior part of the tumot. All
this part was done using the
microscope. Additional dissection more superiorly, led us to encounter the
ventricle. There
was a small opening in the ventricle, but most of the ventricle
wall was left intact. I removed some tumor from the body of the
ventricle lateral as well as superior and a little bit inferior.
At this point, the patient was still speaking relatively well.
We proceeded therefore to obtain intraoperative MRI. The
intraoperative MRI appeared to show that we had a greater than
90% resection. There was some T2 abnormalities to the left in
the corona radiata as well as posteriorly along the sylvian
fissure and along the insula rim.
 So we went back into the cavity and when I looked at
this, it clearly was a clot rather than tumor in all these areas
that I thought were tumor. After removing the clot with the
BrainLAB, it seemed that these T2 bright areas were mor consistent with
edematous brain or potentially infiltrated brain that potentially
could have been eloquent. I therefore desisted from further
surgery in this area. We then proceeded to line the cavity with

large sheets of Surgicel. We made sure the Surgicel was over the
edges of the cortex in all directions. After, made sure that
there was good hemostasis, I proceeded to close. The dura was
closed primarily using interrupted sutures. After closing the
dura primarily, the bone flap was put back in position using
titanium plates and the middle of the bone flap was tented to the
dura. After doing this, we proceeded to irrigate again and
proceeded to close temporalis muscle, muscle fascia
galea and skin as per routine.

ATTESTATION:
I was present and scrubbed for the entire operation.

Pathologist:                   Lynette M Sholl, M.D.

CLINICAL DATA:

        Clinical History: None given.
        Clinical Diagnosis: Astrocytoma


DNA was isolated from a brain tumor biopsy, BS14-41488-B2. DNA methylation
patterns in the CpG island of the MGMT gene (Genbank accession number AL355531
nt46931-47011) was determined by chemical (bisulfite) modification of
unmethylated, but not methylated, cytosines to uracil and subsequent PCR using
primers specific for either methylated or the modified unmethylated DNA
(Esteller et al. Cancer Res. 1999;59:793-797.) The PCR products were analyzed
in duplicate parallel runs by capillary gel electrophoresis. The sensitivity of
the assay based on DNA dilutions studies is at least 1:1000.

RESULT:
The analyzed region of the MGMT promoter is partially METHYLATED (1 of 2
aliquots).

INTERPRETATION:
MGMT (O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair gene. Methylation
of the promotor leads to gene silencing and loss of MGMT expression. A recent
study that tested the methylation status of the same region of the MGMT
promoter in glioblastomas found that MGMT promoter methylation was an
independent favorable prognostic factor and was associated with a survival
benefit in patients treated with temozolamide and radiotherapy. (Hegi M,
Diserans A, Gorlia T et al. MGMT Gene Silencing and Benefit from Temozolomide
in Glioblastoma. N Engl J Med 2005;352:997-1003.)



These tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by
the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital. They have
not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA
has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.

********** Addended Report ***********
Resident: David Meredith, M.D., Ph.D.
Pathologist:   Umberto De Girolami, M.D.

PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

A-D. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED "LEFT FRONTAL TUMOR" (FSA, SMA):
NEWLY DIAGNOSED TUMOR (Surgery #1)

DIFFUSE ASTROCYTOMA, W.H.O. Grade 2 (ICD-0 9400/3)

IDH1(R132H) MUTATION      POSITIVE (by IHC)
TP53 PROTEIN         POSITIVE (by IHC, suggestive of mutation)
BRAF(V600E)          NOT DETECTED (by IHC)


NOTE:
There is evidence that the tumor may lie at the higher end of the grade 2
spectrum with focal regions having slightly higher than average cellularity and
atypia. Mitotic activity was detected in block B1, but this region was very
small (only a few high power fields) and mitoses were not detected in other
regions of the tumor. The proliferation rate in the region with mitotic
activity and the vast majority of the tumor was low (not exceeding 4%).
Therefore while grading as WHO Grade 3 was considered it was not felt to be
warranted at this time given the overall findings in a well sampled tumor.

Classification of the tumor as MIXED GLIOMA, WHO GRADE 2 would also be
appropriate given that reliable criteria for distinction of diffuse astrocytoma
and mixed glioma have not been established and the clinical significance of
distinguishing between these two entities is not clear.

The overall size of the resection is very large.
The tumor infiltrates adjacent brain parenchyma.

W.H.O. Histologic Grading Criteria
Cellularity:             moderate
Atypia:             moderate
Mitoses:            present (but small focal region only)
Vascular Proliferation: not present
Necrosis:           not present

Immunohistochemistry performed at BWH demonstrates the following staining
profile in lesional cells (block B1):

OLIG2                          positive (50% of cells, c/w astrocytoma)
GFAP                           positive (weak, variable)
IDH1(R132H)                         positive (possibly heterogeneous ~70% of cells)
TP53                           positive (50% of cells)

                               SOLID TUMOR ARRAY CGH ANALYSIS


RESULT:
arr[hg19]
3q26.31q28(171,681,429-188,500,069)x3,7p22.3q26.2(42,976-155,143,600)x3,(8)x3

INTERPRETATION:
Several copy number changes were identified following array comparative genomic
hybridization (aCGH) of this formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary
brain tumor specimen. The following genomic imbalances were noted:
(1) a 16.8 Mb single copy gain of 3q, which includes PIK3CA and SOX2,

(2) polysomy 7

(3) polysomy 8

The findings are CONSISTENT the histopathologic diagnosis of a DIFFUSE
ASTROCYTOMA WHO GRADE 2 or other low grade IDH-mutated astrocytoma/mixed
glioma.

Gains involving Chr 7 and 8 are common in diffuse astrocytoma. In isolation
however, they are not specific or diagnostic of low grade glioma or any other
tumor type.

Aberrations commonly correlated with less favorable outcomes in diffuse
astrocytoma (PTEN/10q loss, CDKN2A/9q loss, etc) are NOT DETECTED.

The findings are NOT CONSISTENT with an oligodendroglioma as there is no
evidence for 1p/19q co-deletion.


See Table 1 (below) for a list of selected genes/regions that were evaluated
specifically for this interpretation.

COMMENTS:
Array - based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was performed using the
stock 1x1M Agilent SurePrint G3 Human CGH Microarray chip to identify tumor -
specific genomic copy number changes. Genomic DNA isolated from the FFPE
specimen submitted was hybridized with genomic DNA isolated from a reference
DNA sample representing a pool of karyotypically normal individuals (Promega,
Madison, WI). The array platform contains 963,029 probes spaced across the
human genome with a 2.1 kb overall median probe spacing and a 1.8 kb probe

spacing in RefSeq genes. A genomic imbalance is reported when a minimum of
eight (8) consecutive probes, which correspond to approximately 14-16 kb, show
an average log2 ratio above +0.18 or below -0.30. Amplifications are reported
when an average log2 ratio for a given interval is equal to, or greater than,
+2.0.

This assay cannot exclude: (1) chromosome imbalances when the proportion of
tumor cells in the original sample is less than 50%; (2) chromosome imbalances
smaller than the resolution of the chip, or (3) tumor heterogeneity,
particularly if an abnormal clone is not sufficiently represented in the
original sample. This assay is not designed to identify balanced chromosomal
rearrangements (e.g., balanced reciprocal translocations, inversions or
insertions), ploidy changes, uniparental disomy or DNA methylation. The
composition of this array is based on the UCSC hg19 (GRCh37), Feb. 2009
(http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway). This test was developed and its
performance determined by the BWH Cytogenetics Laboratory as required by the
CLIA '88 regulations. This test is used for clinical purposes.

REPORT:
     MRI BRAIN PRE AND POST IV CONTRAST

        INDICATION: SSX:Perfusion imaging +/- Gad, flair, HX:Glioma. Per
        electronic medical record, patient is a 26-year-old male with
        history of left frontal astrocytoma grade 2 status post resection
        in August 19, 2014 currently in consideration for radiation
        therapy.

        COMPARISON: December 5, 2007, August 8, 2014, August 20, 2014,
        and October 1, 2014

        TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence imaging of the brain was
        performed both pre- and post contrast administration.

         24 mL of gadolinium contrast (Magnevist) was administered IV,
        uneventfully.

        The following specific sequences were acquired: 3 plane
        localizer, sagittal T1, axial FLAIR, coronal FLAIR, sagittal T1
        preand postcontrast, susceptibility weighted, axial T2, axial
        diffusion-weighted with ADC map, 3-D axial T1 MP rage with
        coronal and sagittal reformats, and perfusion sequences.

        FINDINGS:
        Postsurgical change related to prior left frontal craniotomy and
        resection of the nonenhancing mass is again seen with areas of
        susceptibility, consistent with hemorrhagic products from
        surgery. The small subdural collection layering along the left
        frontal lobe is again seen, which appears to have redistributed
        without significant change in size compared to prior exam and
        also demonstrates mild mass effect with partial effacement of
        sulci and mild 4 mm left to right midline shift. The resection
        cavity size has decreased in size compared to October 1, 2014.
        Minimal areas of dural enhancement and rim enhancement within the
        resection cavity is again seen, similar/slightly improved
        compared to prior exam and is likely related to postsurgical
        change. There is no evidence of enhancing masses or intermediate
        restricted diffusion to suggest high cellularity.

        In the superior medial region of the resection cavity, the area
        of thickened, nodular nonenhancing T2 signal abnormality appears
        slightly increased compared to October 1, 2014 with evidence of
        gradual increase in size and diffusivity in comparison to August
        8, 2014. There is also subtle increase in nonenhancing abnormal
        T2 prolongation within the right inferior medial frontal lobe in
        the region of anterior commissure in comparison to October 1,
        2014 and also to August 18, 2014 which is concerning for minimal
        progression of infiltrative tumor.

        There is no evidence of ependymal nodules or abnormal areas of
        dural enhancement or leptomeningeal spread of disease.

                               Radiology from 1/1/2004 through 12/29/2014 (cont)



There is no evidence of infarction. Similar linear CSF intensity
     lesions are seen within the corpus callosum, unchanged from 2007
     and most likely represents anatomic variant of dilated
     perivascular space. The ventricles and sulci are mildly
     prominent, however is unchanged compared to prior exam. Right
     maxillary sinus mucus retention cyst. Otherwise rest of the
     visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
     Orbits are unremarkable. There are normal flow-voids in the major
     intracranial vessels. The skull base and calvarium demonstrate
     normal signal.

        Perfusion: There are no abnormal areas of increased blood volume.

        IMPRESSION:
        1. Gradual increase in volume of nodular low cellularity, low
        vascularity tumor at the left superior medial aspect of resection
        cavity since August 2014 with very slight increase in comparison
        to October 1, concerning for gradual progression of nonenhancing
        low grade tumor. Attention at follow up is suggested.
        2. Very gradual increase in nonenhancing abnormal along the
        inferior medial right frontal lobe and anterior commissure
        concerning for very gradual infiltrative progression. Attention
        at follow up is suggested.
        3. Interval decrease in size of the resection cavity likely
        related to evolution of postoperative findings and slight growth
        of nodular lesion along the left superior medial aspect of
        resection cavity.
        4. Interval redistribution of left frontal subdural collection
        without definite change in size or mild mass effect and minimal
        midline shift.


        I, the teaching physician, have reviewed the images and agree
        with the report as written.

REPORT:
     MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST

        INDICATION: 26-year-old male with glioma.


        COMPARISON: MRI from August 20, 2014

        TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the brain was
        performed with and without IV contrast. The following sequences
        were obtained: 3 plane localizers, sagittal T1, coronal FLAIR,
        axial FLAIR, T1 weighed images were performed without contrast.
        During 22.5 ml Magnevist intravenous gadolinium contrast
        administration, dynamic perfusion axial EPI images with delayed
        axial T2, DWI, T1 and 3-D SPGR images with coronal and sagittal
        reformation were performed. Perfusion data was postprocessed
        off-line by the interpreting radiologists and CBV maps were
        produced.

        FINDINGS:

        Postoperative changes from prior left frontal craniotomy
        including a resection cavity in the left frontal lobe are noted
        with near complete resolution of blood product within the cavity
        and interval decrease in the size of cavity. The subdural
        collection along left convexity has slightly increased. The
        pneumocephalus has resolved. The regions of T2 prolongation
        surrounding the resection cavity has not significant changed,
        although the thickness of abnormality medially and posteriorly
        slightly increased which could be secondary to contraction of
        resection cavity. There is no focal decreased diffusivity.
        Following contrast administration, there is mild linear
        enhancement along the cavity.

        Perfusion imaging shows no evidence of increased blood volume in
        the regions of signal abnormality or elsewhere in the brain.

        IMPRESSION:

        Postsurgical changes with a resection cavity in the left frontal
        lobe, with interval slight increase in the size of subdural
        collection along left convexity. The regions of T2 abnormality
        medial and posterior to the cavity appear slightly more
        prominent, which may be secondary to contraction of cavity versus
        nonenhancing tumor growth. Mild linear enhancement along cavity
        most likely postsurgical. No evidence of enhancing, hypervascular
        or hypercellular tumor progression.


        Critical results were communicated and documented using the Alert
        Notification of Critical Radiology Results (ANCR) system.
