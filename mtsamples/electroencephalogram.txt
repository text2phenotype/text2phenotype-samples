				<p><b>DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  </b>This tracing was obtained utilizing 27 paste-on gold-plated surface disc electrodes placed according to the International 10-20 system.  Electrode impedances were measured and reported at less than 5 kilo-ohms each.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS: </b> In general, the background rhythms are bilaterally symmetrical.  During the resting awake state they are composed of moderate amounts of low amplitude fast activity intermixed with moderate amounts of well-modulated 9-10 Hz alpha activity best seen posteriorly.  The alpha activity attenuates with eye opening.</p>
<p>During some portions of the tracing the patient enters a drowsy state in which the background rhythms are composed predominantly of moderate amounts of low amplitude fast activity intermixed with moderate amounts of low to medium amplitude polymorphic theta activity.</p>
<p>There is no evidence of focal slowing or paroxysmal activity.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION: </b> Normal awake and drowsy (stage I sleep) EEG for patient&#8217;s age.</p>
