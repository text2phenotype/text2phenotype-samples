				<p><b>HISTORY:</b>  The patient is a 25-year-old gentleman who was seen in the emergency room at Children&#8217;s Hospital today.  He brought his 3-month-old daughter in for evaluation but also wanted to be evaluated himself because he has had &quot;rib cage pain&quot; for the last few days.  He denies any history of trauma.  He does have increased pain with laughing.  Per the patient, he also claims to have an elevated temperature yesterday of 101.  Apparently, the patient did go to the emergency room at ABCD yesterday, but due to the long wait, he left without actually being evaluated and then thought that he might be seen today when he came to Children&#8217;s.</p>

<p><b>PLAN: </b> Due to the fact that this patient is an adult male, we will transfer him to XYZ Medical Center for further evaluation.  I have spoken with XYZ Medical Center Dr. X who has accepted the patient for transfer.  He was advised that the patient will be coming in a private vehicle due to fact that he is completely stable and appears to be in no acute distress.  Dr. X was happy to accept the transfer and indicated that the patient should come to the emergency room area with the transport paperwork.  The plan was explained in detail to the patient who stated that he understood and would comply.  The appropriate paperwork was created and one copy was given to the patient.</p>
<p><b>CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: </b> At the time of discharge, he was stable, vital signs stable, in no acute distress.</p>
