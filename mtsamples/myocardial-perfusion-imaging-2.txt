				<p><b>CLINICAL HISTORY: </b> This is a 64-year-old male patient, who had a previous stress test, which was abnormal and hence has been referred for a stress test with imaging for further classification of coronary artery disease and ischemia.</p>
<p><b>PERTINENT MEDICATIONS:</b>  Include Tylenol, Robitussin, Colace, Fosamax, multivitamins, hydrochlorothiazide, Protonix and flaxseed oil.</p>
<p>With the patient at rest 10.5 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi was injected and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained.</p>
<p><b>PROCEDURE AND INTERPRETATION: </b> The patient exercised for a total of 4 minutes and 41 seconds on the standard Bruce protocol.  The peak workload was 7 METs.  The resting heart rate was 61 beats per minute and the peak heart rate was 173 beats per minute, which was 85% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate response.  The blood pressure response was normal with the resting blood pressure 126/86, and the peak blood pressure of 134/90.  EKG at rest showed normal sinus rhythm with a right-bundle branch block.  The peak stress EKG was abnormal with 2 mm of ST segment depression in V3 to V6, which remained abnormal till about 6 to 8 minutes into recovery.  There were occasional PVCs, but no sustained arrhythmia.  The patient had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia at peak stress.  The ischemic threshold was at a heart rate of 118 beats per minute and at 4.6 METs.  At peak stress, the patient was injected with 30.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained, and was compared to resting images.</p>
<p><b>MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING:</b><br />1.  The overall quality of the scan was fair in view of increased abdominal uptake, increased bowel uptake seen.<br />2.  There was a large area of moderate to reduced tracer concentration seen in the inferior wall and the inferior apex.  This appeared to be partially reversible in the resting images.<br />3.  The left ventricle appeared normal in size.<br />4.  Gated SPECT images revealed normal wall motion and normal left ventricular systolic function with normal wall thickening.  The calculated ejection fraction was 70% at rest.</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br />1.  Average exercise tolerance.<br />2.  Adequate cardiac stress.<br />3.  Abnormal EKG response to stress, consistent with ischemia.  No symptoms of chest pain at rest.<br />4.  Myocardial perfusion imaging was abnormal with a large-sized, moderate intensity partially reversible inferior wall and inferior apical defect, consistent with inferior wall ischemia and inferior apical ischemia.<br />5.  The patient had run of SVT at peak stress.<br />6.  Gated SPECT images revealed normal wall motion and normal left ventricular systolic function.</p>
