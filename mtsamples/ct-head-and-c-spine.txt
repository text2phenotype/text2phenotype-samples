				<p><b>CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST AND CT CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST</b></p>
<p><b>REASON FOR EXAM: </b> Motor vehicle collision.</p>
<p><b>CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST</b></p>
<p><b>TECHNIQUE:</b>  Noncontrast axial CT images of the head were obtained.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS: </b> There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift, or extra-axial fluid collection.  The ventricles and cortical sulci are normal in shape and configuration.  The gray/white matter junctions are well preserved.  There is no calvarial fracture.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION: </b> Negative for acute intracranial disease.</p>
<p><b>CT CERVICAL SPINE</b></p>
<p><b>TECHNIQUE:  </b>Noncontrast axial CT images of the cervical spine were obtained.  Sagittal and coronal images were obtained.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS:</b>  Straightening of the normal cervical lordosis is compatible with patient position versus muscle spasms.  No fracture or subluxation is seen.  Anterior and posterior osteophyte formation is seen at C5-C6.  No abnormal anterior cervical soft tissue swelling is seen.  No spinal compression is noted.  The atlanto-dens interval is normal.  There is a large retention cyst versus polyp within the right maxillary sinus.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION:</b><br />1.  Straightening of the normal cervical lordosis compatible with patient positioning versus muscle spasms.<br />2.  Degenerative disk and joint disease at C5-C6.<br />3.  Retention cyst versus polyp of the right maxillary sinus.</p>
