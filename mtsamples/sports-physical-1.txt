Talked about other anticipatory guidance including sunscreen, use of seat belts, and drugs, alcohol, and smoking, and sexual activity and avoidance at her age and to continue on her present medications.  She also has had problems with her ankles in the past.  She had no limitation here, but we gave her some ankle strengthening exercise handouts while she was in the office.</p>
