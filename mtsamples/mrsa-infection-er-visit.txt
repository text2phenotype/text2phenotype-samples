They went to their doctor on Saturday, culture was drawn.  It came back today, growing MRSA.  She has been doing well.  They put her on bacitracin ointment near the umbilicus.  That has about healed up.  However today, they noticed a small blister on her left temporal area.  They called the private doctor.
