				<p><b>EXAM: </b> Transvaginal ultrasound.</p>
<p><b>HISTORY: </b> Pelvic pain.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS: </b> The right ovary measures 1.6 x 3.4 x 2.0 cm.  There are several simple-appearing probable follicular cysts. There is no abnormal flow to suggest torsion on the right.  Left ovary is enlarged, demonstrating a 6.0 x 3.5 x 3.7 cm complex cystic mass of uncertain etiology.  This could represent a large hemorrhagic cyst versus abscess.  There is no evidence for left ovarian torsion.  There is a small amount of fluid in the cul-de-sac likely physiologic.</p>
<p>The uterus measures 7.7 x 5.0 cm.  The endometrial echo is normal at 6 mm.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION:</b><br />1.  No evidence for torsion.<br />2.  Large, complex cystic left ovarian mass as described.  This could represent a large hemorrhagic cyst; however, an abscess/neoplasm cannot be excluded.  Recommend either short interval followup versus laparoscopic evaluation given the large size and complex nature.</p>
