<p><b>HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:</b>  Mrs. XXX is a 17-year-old lady who is going to be 18 in about 3 weeks.  She has been referred for the further evaluation of her thrombocytopenia.  This thrombocytopenia was detected on a routine blood test performed on the 10th of June 2006.  Her hemoglobin was 13.3 with white count of 11.8 at that time.  Her lymphocyte count was 6.7.  The patient, subsequently, had a CBC repeated on the 10th at Hospital where her hemoglobin was 12.4 with a platelet count of 26,000.  She had a repeat of her CBC again on the 12th of June 2006 with hemoglobin of 14, white count of 11.6 with an increase in the number of lymphocytes.  Platelet count was 38.  Her rapid strep screen was negative but the infectious mononucleosis screen is positive.  The patient had a normal platelet count prior too and she is being evaluated for this low platelet count.</p>

<p><b>IMPRESSION: </b> ITP, the patient has a normal platelet count.</p>
<p><b>PLAN:</b><br />1.  I had a long discussion with family regarding the treatment of ITP.

An ultrasound of the abdomen will be performed tomorrow.<br />3.  I have given her a requisition to obtain some blood work tomorrow.</p>
