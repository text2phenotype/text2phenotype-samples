<p><b>PLAN:</b><br />1.  Diffuse esophageal dilatation/hematemesis.  We will put her n.p.o., we will give IV fluid, half normal saline D5 100 mL per hour.  I discussed the case with Dr. Y, gastroenterologist.  The patient planned for EGD starting today.  Differential diagnosis may include foreign body, achalasia, Candida infection, or CMV esophagitis.  We will treat according to the EGD findings.  We will give IV Nexium 40 mg daily for GI prophylaxis.  We will hold all p.o. medication.<br />2.  CHF.  Cardiomegaly on x-ray.  She is clinically stable.  Lungs are clear.  No radiological sign of CHF exacerbation.  We will restart lisinopril and metoprolol after EGD study will be completed.<br />3.  HIV &#8211; follow up by Dr. X, (ABCD Medical Center).  The last visit was on 08/08.  The patient was not taking her HIV medications for the last 3 months and does not know her CD4 number or viral load.  We will check CD4 number and viral load.  We will contact Dr. X (ID specialist in ABCD Med).<br />4.  Hypertension.  We will control blood pressor with Lopressor 5 mg IV p.r.n.  If blood pressure more than 160/90, we will hold metoprolol and lisinopril.<br />5.  Hepatitis C, known since 1995.  The patient does not take any treatment.<br />6.  Tobacco abuse.  The patient refused nicotine patch.<br />7.  GI prophylaxis as stated above; and DVT prophylaxis, compression socks.  We will restrain from using heparin or Lovenox.</p>
<p><b>ADDENDUM: </b> The patient was examined by Dr. Y, gastroenterologist, who ordered a CAT scan with oral contrast, which showed persistent distention of the esophagus with elementary debris within the lumen of the esophagus.  There is no evidence of leakage of the oral contrast.  There is decrease in size of periaortic soft tissue density around the descending aorta, this is associated with increase in very small left pleural effusion in the intervening time.  There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax, lungs are clear, contrast is present in stomach.  After procedure, the patient had profuse vomiting with bloody content and spiked fever 102.  The patient felt relieved after vomiting.  The patient was started on aztreonam 1 g IV every 8 hours, Flagyl 500 mg IV every 8 hours.  ID consult was called and thoracic surgeon consult was ordered.</p>
