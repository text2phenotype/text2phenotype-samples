<p><b>POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  </b>Rule out temporal arteritis.</p>
<p><b>PROCEDURE:</b>  Bilateral temporal artery biopsy.</p>
<p><b>ANESTHESIA:</b>  Local anesthesia 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine.</p>
<p><b>INDICATIONS:</b>  I was consulted by Dr. X for this patient with bilateral temporal headaches to rule out temporal arteritis.  I explained fully the procedure to the patient.</p>
<p><b>PROCEDURE: </b> Both sides were done exactly the same way.  After 1% Xylocaine infiltration, a 2 to 3-cm incision was made over the temporal artery.  The temporal artery was identified and was grossly normal on both sides.  Proximal and distal were ligated with both of 3-0 silk suture and Hemoccult.  The specimen of temporal artery was taken from both sides measuring at least 2 to 3 cm.  They were sent as separate specimens, right and left labeled.  The wound was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures and Dermabond.  She tolerated the procedure well.</p>
