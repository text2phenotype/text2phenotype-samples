<p><b>MAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION:</b><br />1.  A certain percentage of cancers, probably 10% to 15%, will not be identified by mammography.<br />2.  Lack of radiographic evidence of malignancy should not delay a biopsy if a clinically suspicious mass is present.<br />3.  These images were obtained with FDA-approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD Second Look Software Version 7.2 was utilized.</p>
