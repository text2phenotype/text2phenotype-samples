				<p><b>PROCEDURE: </b> Flexible sigmoidoscopy.</p>
<p><b>PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:</b>  Rectal bleeding.</p>
<p><b>POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  </b>Diverticulosis.</p>
<p><b>MEDICATIONS: </b> None.</p>
<p><b>DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  </b>The Olympus gastroscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon for a distance of 90 cm, reaching the proximal descending colon.  At this point, stool occupied the lumen, preventing further passage.  The colon distal to this was well cleaned out and easily visualized.  The mucosa was normal throughout the regions examined.  Numerous diverticula were seen.  There was no blood or old blood or active bleeding.  A retroflexed view of the anorectal junction showed no hemorrhoids.  He tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.</p>
<p><b>FINAL DIAGNOSES:</b><br />1.  Sigmoid and left colon diverticulosis.<br />2.  Otherwise normal flexible sigmoidoscopy to the proximal descending colon.<br />3.  The bleeding was most likely from a diverticulum, given the self limited but moderately severe quantity that he described.</p>
<p><b>RECOMMENDATIONS:</b><br />1.  Follow up with Dr. X as needed.<br />2.  If there is further bleeding, a full colonoscopy is recommended.</p>
