She had been followed by Dr. Mills, but decided to see Dr. XYZ who referred to her Dr Isaac.  She underwent several tests.  She did have magnetic resonance angiography of the lower extremities and the aorta which were normal.  She had nerve conduction study that showed several peripheral polyneuropathy.  She reports that she has myelogram last week but has not got results of this.  She reports that the rest of her tests have been normal, but it seems that vertebrae shift when she stands and then pinches the nerve.
