				<p><b>REASON FOR VISIT:</b>  Six-month follow-up visit for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF).</p>
<p>She reports that she is getting occasional chest pains with activity.  Sometimes she feels that at night when she is lying in bed and it concerns her.</p>
<p>She is frustrated by her inability to lose weight even though she is hyperthyroid.</p>
<p><b>MEDICATIONS: </b> Tapazole 10 mg b.i.d., atenolol/chlorthalidone 50/25 mg b.i.d., Micro-K 10 mEq q.d., Lanoxin 0.125 mg q.d., spironolactone 25 mg q.d., Crestor 10 mg q.h.s., famotidine 20 mg, Bayer Aspirin 81 mg q.d., Vicodin p.r.n., and Nexium 40 mg-given samples of this today.</p>
<p><b>REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:</b>  No palpitations.  No lightheadedness or presyncope.  She is having mild pedal edema, but she drinks a lot of fluid.</p>
<p><b>PEX: </b> BP:  112/74.  PR:  70.  WT:  223 pounds (up three pounds).  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm with a 1/6 murmur at the upper sternal border.  Chest:  Nontender.  Lungs:  Clear.  Abdomen:  Moderately overweight.  Extremities:  Trace edema.</p>
<p><b>EKG: </b> Sinus bradycardia at 58 beats per minute, mild inferolateral ST abnormalities.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION:</b><br />1.  Chest pain-Mild.  Her EKG is mildly abnormal.  Her last stress echo was in 2001.  I am going to have her return for one just to make sure it is nothing serious.  I suspect; however, that is more likely due to her weight and acid reflux.  I gave her samples of Nexium.<br />2.  Mild pedal edema-Has to cut down on fluid intake, weight loss will help as well, continue with the chlorthalidone.<br />3.  PAF-Due to hypertension, hyperthyroidism and hypokalemia.  Staying in sinus rhythm.<br />4.  Hyperthyroidism-Last TSH was mildly suppressed, she had been out of her Tapazole for a while, now back on it.<br />5.  Dyslipidemia-Samples of Crestor given.<br />6.  LVH.<br />7.  Menometrorrhagia.</p>
<p><b>PLAN:</b><br />1.  Return for stress echo.<br />2.  Reduce the fluid intake to help with pedal edema.<br />3.  Nexium trial.</p>
