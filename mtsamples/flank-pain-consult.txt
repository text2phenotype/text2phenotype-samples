				<p><strong>CHIEF COMPLAINT: </strong>Left flank pain and unable to urinate.</p>
<p><strong>HISTORY: </strong>The patient is a 46-year-old female who presented to the emergency room with left flank pain and difficulty urinating. Details are in the history and physical. She does have a vague history of a bruised left kidney in a motor vehicle accident. She feels much better today. I was consulted by Dr. X.</p>
<p><strong>MEDICATIONS:</strong> Ritalin 50 a day.</p>
<p><strong>ALLERGIES: </strong>To penicillin.</p>
<p><strong>PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: </strong>ADHD.</p>
<p><strong>SOCIAL HISTORY:</strong> No smoking, alcohol, or drug abuse.</p>
<p><strong>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: </strong>She is awake, alert, and quite comfortable. Abdomen is benign. She points to her left flank, where she was feeling the pain.</p>
<p><strong>DIAGNOSTIC DATA: </strong>Her CAT scan showed a focal ileus in left upper quadrant, but no thickening, no obstruction, no free air, normal appendix, and no kidney stones.</p>
<p><strong>LABORATORY WORK: </strong>Showed white count 6200, hematocrit 44.7. Liver function tests and amylase were normal. Urinalysis 3+ bacteria.</p>
<p><strong>IMPRESSION:</strong><br />
1. Left flank pain, question etiology.<br />
2. No evidence of surgical pathology.<br />
3. Rule out urinary tract infection.</p>
<p><strong>PLAN:</strong><br />
1. No further intervention from my point of view.<br />
2. Agree with discharge and followup as an outpatient. Further intervention will depend on how she does clinically. She fully understood and agreed.</p>
