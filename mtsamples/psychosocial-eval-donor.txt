				<p><b>DONOR&#8217;S PERCEPTION OF RECIPIENT&#8217;S ILLNESS:</b></p>
<p>What is your understanding of the recipient&#8217;s illness and why they need a kidney &#8211; &quot;This kidney is for my mother who is on dialysis and my mother has been suffering long enough, and I want to relieve the suffering so that she is able to have a kidney transplant.&quot;</p>
<p>When and how did subject of donation arise &#8211; &quot;My mom and I talked about it together as a family.&quot;</p>
<p><b>RECIPIENT&#8217;S REACTION TO OFFER:</b></p>
<p>What was the recipient&#8217;s reaction to your offer:  &quot;I would rather not go there.  Well, since we were talking, &quot;I will tell you that my mother really does not understand.  She is very worried.  She is very afraid that something might happen to me, and she would feel terrible if I had any problems as a result of being a donor.  I don&#8217;t think my mom really understands, and I know that she really needs a kidney.  I think she is coming around to accepting.&quot;</p>
<p><b>FAMILY&#8217;S REACTION TO OFFER:</b></p>
<p>What are your family feelings about your being a donor &#8211; &quot;Well, my children are fine and my husband is very supportive.&quot;</p>
<p><b>CANDIDATE&#8217;S MOTIVATION TO DONATE:</b></p>
<p>How did you arrive at the decision to be a donor &#8211; &quot;My brothers and sisters and I got together and we all decided since my schedule was the most flexible and I was used to traveling, I seem like to the best candidate.&quot;</p>
<p>How would your family and friends react if you decided not to be a donor &#8211; &quot;I don&#8217;t think that is going to happen.&quot;</p>
<p><b>CANDIDATE&#8217;S MOTIVATION TO DONATE:</b></p>
<p>How would you feel if you cannot be the donor for any reason &#8211; &quot;I would feel very upset because I know that this is the best for my mother, and I want to do this very badly for my mother.  I am hoping my headache is away and my blood pressure comes down so that I will start to feel better during this workup.&quot;</p>
<p><b>CANDIDATE&#8217;S DESCRIPTION OF RELATIONSHIP WITH RECIPIENT:</b></p>
<p>What is your relationship to the recipient &#8211; &quot;That is my mother.&quot;</p>
<p>How your relationship with the recipient change if you donate your kidney &#8211; &quot;I am not sure that it will change at all.  I know that I will feel better about doing this for my mother, because my mother is always sacrificing and helping others.&quot;</p>
<p>With your being a donor affect any other relationships in your life &#8211; No, I don&#8217;t think it will have that much of an impact.  I am away from my children and my husband a lot because of I travel with my job.  So I don&#8217;t think being donor will really have that dramatic affect.</p>
<p>Do you have an understanding of the process of transplant &#8211; &quot;Yes, I have a very good understanding of the transplant process.  I work as a contract nursing all over the country.

<p>Do you understand the risk of rejection of your kidney by the recipient &#8211; &quot;Yes, I do understand all the risks.  I have had a long conversation with the coordinator and we have talked about these things.&quot;</p>
<p>Have you thought about how you might feel if the kidney is rejected &#8211; &quot;I guess, I am just sure that I won&#8217;t be rejected and I am just sure that everything will be fine.  It is a part of the way I am managing my stress about this.&quot;</p>
<p>Do you have any doubts or concerns about donating &#8211; &quot;No, I don&#8217;t have any doubts or any concerns right now.  I just wish this headache would go away.</p>
<p>Do you understand that there will be pain after the transplant &#8211; &quot;Of course, I do.&quot;</p>
<p>What are your expectations about your recuperation &#8211; &quot;I am planning on staying with my mom for three months in the Houston area after the transplant.  We live outside of Tampa, Florida; so this will be an adventure for both of us.&quot;</p>
