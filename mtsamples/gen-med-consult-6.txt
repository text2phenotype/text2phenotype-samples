<p><b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br />General:  She is a well-developed, well-nourished, elderly female in no acute distress.<br />Vital Signs:  Her age is 81.  Temperature:  98.0.  Blood pressure:  140/70.  Pulse:  72.  Weight:  127.<br />HEENT:  Head was normocephalic.  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Fundi are benign.  TMs, nares, and throat were clear.<br />Neck:  Supple without adenopathy or thyromegaly.<br />Lungs:  Clear.<br />Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, click, or rub.  No carotid bruits are heard.<br />Abdomen:  Normal bowel sounds.  It is soft and nontender without hepatosplenomegaly or mass.<br />Breasts:  Surgically absent.  No chest wall mass was noted, except for the Port-A-Cath in the left chest.  No axillary adenopathy is noted.<br />Extremities:  Examination of the extremities reveals no ankle edema or calf tenderness x 2 in lower extremities.

<p><b>ASSESSMENT:</b><br />1.  Peripheral neuropathy primarily of the right foot.<br />2.  Hypertension.<br />3.  Hypothyroidism.<br />4.  Essential thrombocythemia.<br />5.  Allergic rhinitis.<br />6.  Insomnia.</p>
<p><b>PLAN:</b>  I prescribed Neurontin 100 mg dispensed 30 with five refills one to two p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. peripheral neuropathy.  I offered Anodyne physical therapy, but she was not interested yet at this point.  I suspect that her peripheral neuropathy may be due to her essential thrombocythemia.  We did send her to lab for a CBC due to her anemia and essential thrombocythemia and she needs sed rate due to her peripheral neuropathy, ferritin due to her anemia, and Hemoccult cards x 3 due to anemia.  She needs a DT immunization.  Recheck with me in about three months.  I refilled her Ambien 5 mg at h.s. for one year.  She may get a flu shot next month.</p>
