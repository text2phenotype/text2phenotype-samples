<p><b>POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES</b><br />1.  Bowel obstruction.<br />2.  Central line fell off.</p>
<p><b>PROCEDURE: </b> Insertion of a triple-lumen central line through the right subclavian vein by the percutaneous technique.</p>
<p><b>PROCEDURE DETAIL: </b> This lady has a bowel obstruction.  She was being fed through a central line, which as per the patient was just put yesterday and this slipped out.  At the patient&#8217;s bedside after obtaining an informed consent, the patient&#8217;s right deltopectoral area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated and with the patient in Trendelenburg position, she had her right subclavian vein percutaneously cannulated without any difficulty.  A Seldinger technique was used and a triple-lumen catheter was inserted.  There was a good flow through all three ports, which were irrigated with saline prior to connection to the IV solutions.</p>
<p>The catheter was affixed to the skin with sutures and then a dressing was applied.</p>
<p>The postprocedure chest x-ray revealed that there were no complications to the procedure and that the catheter was in good place.</p>
