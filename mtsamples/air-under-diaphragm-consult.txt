				<p><b>REASON FOR CONSULTATION: </b> Possible free air under the diaphragm.</p>
<p><b>HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: </b> The patient is a 77-year-old female who is unable to give any information.  She has been sedated with Ativan and came into the emergency room obtunded and unable to give any history.  On a chest x-ray for what appeared to be shortness of breath she was found to have what was thought to be free air under the right diaphragm.</p>
<p><b>PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: </b> Significant for alcohol abuse.  Unable to really gather any other information because she is so obtunded.</p>
<p><b>PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  </b>Looking at the medical chart, she had an appendectomy, right hip fracture from a fall in 2005, and TAH/BSO.</p>
<p><b>MEDICATIONS:</b>  Unable to evaluate.</p>
<p><b>ALLERGIES: </b> UNABLE TO EVALUATE.</p>
<p><b>SOCIAL HISTORY:  </b>Significant history of alcohol abuse, according to the emergency room physician, who sees her on a regular basis.</p>
<p><b>REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: </b> Unable to obtain.</p>
<p><b>PHYSICAL EXAM</b><br />VITAL SIGNS:  Temp 98.3, heart rate 82, respiratory rate 24, and blood pressure 141/70.<br />GENERAL:  She is a very obtunded female who upon arousal is not able to provide any information of any use.<br />HEENT:  Atraumatic.<br />NECK:  Soft and supple.<br />LUNGS:  Bilaterally diminished.<br />HEART:  Regular.<br />ABDOMEN:  Soft, and with deep palpation I am unable to arouse the patient, unable to elicit any tenderness.</p>
<p><b>LABORATORY STUDIES: </b> Show a normal white blood cell count with no shift.  Elevated AST at 138, with a normal ALT at 38.  Alkaline phosphatase of 96, bilirubin 0.8.  Sodium is 107, with 68 chloride and potassium of 2.8.</p>
<p>X-ray of the chest shows the possibility of free air; therefore, a CT scan was obtained because of the patient&#8217;s physical examination, which shows no evidence of intra-abdominal pathology.  The etiology of the air under the diaphragm is actually a colonic air that is anterior superior to the dome of the diaphragm, near the dome of the liver.</p>
<p><b>ASSESSMENT: </b> No intra-abdominal pathology.</p>
<p><b>PLAN:</b>  Have her admitted to the medical service for treatment of her hyponatremia.</p>
