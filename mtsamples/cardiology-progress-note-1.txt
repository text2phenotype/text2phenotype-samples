				<p><b>SUBJECTIVE: </b> The patient is not in acute distress.</p>
<p><b>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:</b><br />VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure of 121/63, pulse is 75, and O2 saturation is 94% on room air.<br />HEAD AND NECK:  Face is symmetrical.  Cranial nerves are intact.<br />CHEST:  There is prolonged expiration.<br />CARDIOVASCULAR:  First and second heart sounds are heard.  No murmur was appreciated.<br />ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  Bowel sounds are positive.<br />EXTREMITIES:  He has 2+ pedal swelling.<br />NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is asleep, but easily arousable.</p>
<p><b>LABORATORY DATA:</b>  PTT is 49.  INR is pending.  BUN is improved to 20.6, creatinine is 0.7, sodium is 123, and potassium is 3.8.  AST is down to 45 and ALT to 99.</p>
<p><b>DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: </b> Nuclear stress test showed moderate size, mostly fixed defect involving the inferior wall with a small area of peri-infarct ischemia.  Ejection fraction is 25%.</p>
<p><b>ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:</b><br />1.  Congestive heart failure due to rapid atrial fibrillation and systolic dysfunction.  Continue current treatment as per Cardiology.  We will consider adding ACE inhibitors as renal function improves.<br />2.  Acute pulmonary edema, resolved.<br />3.  Rapid atrial fibrillation, rate controlled.  The patient is on beta-blockers and digoxin.  Continue Coumadin.  Monitor INR.<br />4.  Coronary artery disease with ischemic cardiomyopathy.  Continue beta-blockers.<br />5.  Urinary tract infection.  Continue Rocephin.<br />6.  Bilateral perfusion secondary to congestive heart failure.  We will monitor.<br />7.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stable.<br />8.  Abnormal liver function due to congestive heart failure with liver congestion, improving.<br />9.  Rule out hypercholesterolemia.  We will check lipid profile.<br />10.  Tobacco smoking disorder.  The patient has been counseled.<br />11.  Hyponatremia, stable.  This is due to fluid overload.  Continue diuresis as per Nephrology.<br />12.  Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.  The patient is on heparin drip.</p>
