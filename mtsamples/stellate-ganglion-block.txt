				<p><b>PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:</b>  Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, right upper extremity.</p>
<p><b>POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:</b>  Same.</p>
<p><b>OPERATION:</b>      Stellate ganglion block.</p>
<p><b>ANESTHESIA:</b>      Local and sedation.</p>
<p><b>COMPLICATIONS:</b>      None.</p>
<p><b>DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:</b>  The procedure risks and hazards were discussed with the patient and a proper consent was obtained.  The patient was monitored by appropriately and then placed in a supine position on a fluoroscopy table with a shoulder roll in place with the cervical spine in a slightly extended position, as much as tolerated.  The affected side was prepped with antiseptic solution and draped in a sterile classical fashion.</p>
<p>The cricoid cartilage is palpated and the fingertips are moved laterally, displacing the sternocleidomastoid and the carotid sheath laterally.  Chassaignac&#8217;s tubercle, the transverse process of the 6th cervical vertebra, is identified under fluoroscopic control palpated and then isolated between two palpating fingertips.  Once the carotid sheath is out of the way, a 22-gauge needle is inserted perpendicularly to all planes and placed on the anterior lateral border of the C-6 vertebral body and then withdrawn 1-2 millimeters before a negative aspiration is performed for heme and CSF.  Three to five milliliters of nonionic radio-opaque contrast media is injected and noted to flow over the lateral borders of the ipsilateral cervical vertebral bodies.  This is followed by an injection of 10cc of Marcaine 0.25% in aliquots of 2 cc with negative aspirations between injections.</p>
<p>The patient tolerated the procedure well without any evidence of complications or problems.  They were experiencing evidence of a Horner&#8217;s sign after the block was established.  They were experiencing relief from their pain after the block had set.</p>
