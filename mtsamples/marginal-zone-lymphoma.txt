A mass was found in her right breast on physical examination.  On 07/19/10, she had a mammogram and ultrasound, which confirmed the right breast mass.

<p><b>ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  </b>MALT lymphoma.  This time we need to check PET for staging purposes.  I will also schedule her for a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate.  The risks and benefits of an unsedated bone marrow biopsy and an aspirate were discussed with her and she consents to proceed without sedation.  I am also going to schedule an EGD.  I will also check a CBC, CMP and LDH.  I will see her back when I have the results of her staging studies.  We will then discuss further treatment at that time.</p>
