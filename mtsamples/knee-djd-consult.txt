				<p><b>CHIEF COMPLAINT: </b> Left knee pain and stiffness.</p>
<p><b>HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: </b> The patient is a 57-year-old with severe bilateral knee DJD, left greater than right, with significant pain and limitations because of both.  He is able to walk approximately a 1/2-mile a day but is limited because of his knees.  Stairs are negotiated 1 at a time.  His problems with bilateral knee DJD have been well documented.  He had arthroscopy in the 1991/199two time frame for both of these.  He has been on long-standing conservative course for these including nonsteroidals, narcotics, injections.  At this point because of his progressive and persistent limitations he has opted for total joint surgery on the left side.  He does have other arthritic complaints including multiple back surgeries for spinal stenosis including decompression and epidural steroids.  Significant pain is handled by narcotic medication.  His attending physician is Dr. X.</p>
