				<p><b>REASON FOR EXAM: </b> Followup for fetal growth. </p>
<p><b>INTERPRETATION: </b> Real-time exam demonstrates a single intrauterine fetus in cephalic presentation with a regular cardiac rate of 147 beats per minute documented. </p>
<p><b>FETAL BIOMETRY:  </b><br />BPD = 8.3 cm = 33 weeks, 4 days<br />HC = 30.2 cm = 33 weeks, 4 days<br />AC = 27.9 cm = 32 weeks, 0 days<br />FL =  6.4 cm = 33 weeks, 1 day</p>
<p>The head to abdomen circumference ratio is normal at 1.08, and the femur length to abdomen circumference ratio is normal at 23.0%.  Estimated fetal weight is 2,001 grams.  </p>
<p>The amniotic fluid volume appears normal, and the calculated index is normal for the age at 13.7 cm.  </p>
<p>A detailed fetal anatomic exam was not performed at this setting, this being a limited exam for growth.  The placenta is posterofundal and grade 2.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION: </b> Single viable intrauterine pregnancy in cephalic presentation with a composite gestational age of 32 weeks, 5 days, plus or minus 17 days, giving and estimated date of confinement of 8/04/05.  There has been normal progression of fetal growth compared to the two prior exams of 2/11/05 and 4/04/05.  The examination of 4/04/05 questioned an echogenic focus within the left ventricle.  The current examination does not demonstrate any significant persistent echogenic focus involving the left ventricle.</p>
