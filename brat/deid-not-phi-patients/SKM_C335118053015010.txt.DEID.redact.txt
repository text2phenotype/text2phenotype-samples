Blood pressure: 150/77 mm Hg
Pulse: 75 beats per minute
The temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are normal.
There is paraspinal tenderness in the lumbar region and mild (1+) nonpitting
edema of the left calf and ankle.
The remainder of the examination is normal.
Blood tests:
Hematocrit: 33.8% (reference range, 36.0 to 46.0)
Hemoglobin level 11.3 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0 g/dL)
Ddimer level: **** ng per milliliter (reference range, <500).
The white cell count, differential count, platelet count, red cell indexes,
prothrombin time, prothrombin time international normalized ratio, renal and
liver function tests and, urinalysis are normal,
Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, total
protein, albumin, and globulin: Normal
Creatine kinase, isoenzymes and troponin : Negative.
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm with nonspecific STsegment and Twave
abnormalities that are more marked than those seen on an electrocardiogram
obtained 8 months earlier.
Noninvasive studies of the legs revealed no evidence of deep venous
thrombosis.
Radiology exams: (**********)
CT of the chest with contrast material, in accordance with a pulmonary
embolism protocol (CTPE)
Results: A right apical soft tissue lesion (4.0 cm in cross-sectional diameter)
that extended into the lateral chest wall was present. Enlarged bilateral axillary
lymph nodes (up to 1.8 cm in cross-sectional diameter) were also present and
enlarged bilateral hilar lymph nodes (1.0 cm in cross sectional diameter) were
present without other mediastinal lymphadenopathy. In the upper abdomen
the superior aspect of a large retroperitoneal soft tissue mass measuring 11cm
x 7 cm at the level of the renal arteries was identified (incompletely imaged)
with hydronephrosis and left renal invasion
(UPLOAD SLIDES # 9, 10, 11 and 12).
CT DVT lower extremity: (**********)
Results: Inferior extent of bulky retroperitoneal mass with hydronephrosis
And mesenteric infiltration. (Upload Slide #13)
CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis: (*********)
Results: Massive conglomerate of enlarged lymph nodes extending
from the level of the celiac axis to below the aortic bifurcation and into the
pelvis resulting in marked attenuation of the renal vessels and inferior vena
cava, hydronephrosis of the right kidney, and infiltration of soft tissue into the
left kidney. The soft tissue abnormality extended into the small bowel
mesentery and along the pelvic sidewalls. The liver and spleen were normal, as
were all the other abdominal organs and the bowel
(Upload slides# 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18. If possible, if not we can select only 14,
16, and 18)
Imaging guided aspiration and core biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass:
(**********)
Pathology report: (to be created).
The specimen is composed of tiny fragments of tissue that contain a dense,
vaguely nodular infiltrate. The infiltrate consists of small irregular lymphoid
cells, which are consistent with centrocytes, and infrequent larger cells with
round nuclei and distinct nucleoli, which are consistent with centroblasts, and
it has areas of compartmentalizing sclerosis and focal extension into adipose
tissue. (Upload slides # 30, 31, 32).
Immunohistochemical stains show:
The majority of cells were CD20+ B cells that coexpressed BCL6, CD10, and
BCL2. There are scattered CD3+ T cells and focal areas with CD21 staining of
follicular dendritic cell meshworks
Ki67 staining, the proliferation index is less than 10%.
(Upload slides: 34 and 35)
Flow cytometry:
Shows a population of CD20+CD19+ B cells with faint CD10 expression, no CD5
expression, and monotypic expression of kappa immunoglobulin light chain.
(Upload slide # 36)
Dual color-dual fusion fluorescence in situ hybridization:
The t(14;18) (432;921) rearrangement of the IgH-BCL2 gene was identified.
(Upload slide: 92)
Additional information:
Tumor Type:
Follicular lymphoma, Grade 1-2 of 3, follicular pattern.
CD19+ CD20+ CD10+ BCL2+ BCL6+ Ki67 <10%; CD21+ FDC meshworks
throughout.
BCL2-IGH re-arrangement by FISH

The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI):
1. age : **
2. Ann Arbor stage : IV
3. Hemoglobin level : 113 g/L
4. Number of nodal areas : 4

New Patient
Point of discussion:
A ******* old patient newly diagnosed with an advanced Stage IV Follicular
lymphoma, Grade 1-2 of 3 with follicular pattern, is seeking a treatment
decision.
Patient summary:
A ** y/o patient presents to the toy ith leg swelling and back pain that
had started 3 days ago with a mild LLE swelling noticed 3 months earlier.
Clinical examination, radiology exams and pathology analysis confirm the
diagnosis of a stage IV Follicular lymphoma, Grade 1-2 of 3, follicular
pattern with BCL2-IGH re-arrangement and more than 3 adverse factors
(FLIPI).
Next steps:
>> Due to advanced stage IV disease, this patient is not a candidate for
definitive radiation therapy.
> Palliative treatment directed at her bulky retroperitoneal disease is
considered. However, due to burden of disease elsewhere, systemic
therapy is recommended.
Therapy with rituximab (R) plus cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and
prednisone (CVP), (****) is recommended and the patient will be seen
after completing six cycles of treatment.
R-CVP regimen every 21 d for six cycles
Rituximab 375 mg/m 2 IV on day 1
Cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 IV on day 1
Vincristine 1.4 mg/m 2 (dose cap at 2 mg) IV on day 1
Prednisone 40 mg/m 2 PO on days 1-5.
