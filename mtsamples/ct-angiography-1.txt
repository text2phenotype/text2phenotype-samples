				<p><b>CT ANGIOGRAPHY CHEST WITH CONTRAST</b></p>
<p><b>REASON FOR EXAM:  </b>Shortness of breath for two weeks and a history of pneumonia.  The patient also has a history of left lobectomy.</p>
<p><b>TECHNIQUE: </b> Axial CT images of the chest were obtained for pulmonary embolism protocol utilizing 100 mL of Isovue-300.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS: </b> There is no evidence of any acute pulmonary arterial embolism.</p>
<p>The main pulmonary artery is enlarged showing a diameter of 4.7 cm.</p>
<p>Cardiomegaly is seen with mitral valvular calcifications.</p>
<p>Postsurgical changes of a left upper lobectomy are seen.  Left lower lobe atelectasis is noted.  A 7 mm and a 5 mm pulmonary nodule are seen within the left lower lobe (image #12).  A small left pleural effusion is noted.</p>
<p>Right lower lobe atelectasis is present.  There is a right pleural effusion, greater than as seen on the left side.  A right lower lobe pulmonary nodule measures 1.5 cm.  There is a calcified granuloma within the right lower lobe.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION:</b><br />1.  Negative for pulmonary arterial embolism.<br />2.  Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery as can be seen with pulmonary arterial hypertension.<br />3.  Cardiomegaly with mitral valvular calcifications.<br />4.  Postsurgical changes of a left upper lobectomy.<br />5.  Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.<br />6.  Bilateral lower lobe nodules, pulmonary nodules, and interval followup in three months to confirm stability versus further characterization with prior studies is advised.</p>
