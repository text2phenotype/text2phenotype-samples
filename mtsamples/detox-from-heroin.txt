				<p><b>CHIEF COMPLAINT:</b>  Detox from heroin.</p>
<p><b>HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: </b> This is a 52-year-old gentleman with a long history of heroin abuse, who keeps relapsing, presents once again, trying to get off the heroin, last use shortly prior to arrival including cocaine.  The patient does have a history of alcohol abuse, but mostly he is concerned about the heroin abuse.</p>
<p><b>PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: </b> Remarkable for chronic pain.  He has had multiple stab wounds, gunshot wounds, and a variety of other injuries that resulted him having chronic pain and he states that is what triggers of him getting on heroin to try to get out of pain.  He has previously been followed by ABC but has not seen him for several years.</p>
<p><b>REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  </b>The patient states that he did use heroin as well as cocaine earlier today and feels under the influence.  Denies any headache or visual complaints.  No hallucinations.  No chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain or back pain.  Denies any abscesses.</p>
<p><b>SOCIAL HISTORY: </b> The patient is a smoker.  Admits to heroin use, alcohol abuse as well.  Also admits today using cocaine.</p>
<p><b>FAMILY HISTORY:</b>  Noncontributory.</p>
<p><b>MEDICATIONS: </b> He has previously been on analgesics and pain medications chronically.  Apparently, he just recently got out of prison.  He has previously also been on Klonopin and lithium.  He was previously on codeine for this pain.</p>
<p><b>ALLERGIES: </b> NONE.</p>
<p><b>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: </b> VITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile.  He is markedly hypertensive, 175/104 and pulse 117 probably due to the cocaine onboard.  His respiratory rate is normal at 18.  GENERAL:  The patient is a little jittery but lucid, alert, and oriented to person, place, time, and situation.  HEENT:  Unremarkable.  Pupils are actually moderately dilated about 4 to 5 mm, but reactive.  Extraoculars are intact.  His oropharynx is clear.  NECK:  Supple.  His trachea is midline.  LUNGS:  Clear.  He has good breath sounds and no wheezing.  No rales or rhonchi.  Good air movement and no cough.  CARDIAC:  Without murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  He has multiple track marks, multiple tattoos, but no abscesses.  NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.</p>
<p><b>IMPRESSION: </b> MEDICAL EXAMINATION FOR THE PATIENT WHO WILL BE DETOXING FROM HEROIN.</p>
<p><b>ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  </b>At this time, I think the patient can be followed up at XYZ.  I have written a prescription of clonidine and Phenergan for symptomatic relief and this has been faxed to the pharmacy.  I do not think he needs any further workup at this time.  He is discharged otherwise in stable condition.</p>
