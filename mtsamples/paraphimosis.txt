<p><b>FINDINGS: </b> Paraphimosis with moderate swelling.</p>
<p><b>INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: </b> The patient is a 15-year-old boy who had acute alcohol intoxication had his foreskin retracted with a Foley catheter placed at another institution.

<p><b>DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: </b> The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, with manual pressure and mobilization of the shaft skin we were able to reduce the paraphimosis.

He did quite well after the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.</p>
