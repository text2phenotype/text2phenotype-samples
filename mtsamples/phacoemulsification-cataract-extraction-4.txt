<p><b>POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: </b> Cataract, right eye.</p>
<p><b>PROCEDURE: </b> Cataract extraction with phacoemulsification and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation.  ME 30, AC 25.0 diopter lens was used.</p>
<p><b>COMPLICATIONS:  </b>None.</p>
<p><b>ANESTHESIA: </b> Local 2%, peribulbar lidocaine.</p>
<p><b>PROCEDURE NOTE:  </b>Right eye was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Lid speculum placed in his right eye.  Paracentesis made supratemporally.  Viscoat injected into the anterior chamber.  A 2.8 mm metal keratome blade was then used to fashion a clear corneal beveled incision temporally.  This was followed by circular capsulorrhexis and hydrodissection of the nucleus would be assessed.  Nuclear material removed via phacoemulsification.  Residual cortex removed via irrigation and aspiration.  The posterior capsule was clear and intact.  Capsular bag was then filled with Provisc solution.  The wound was enlarged to 3.5 mm with the keratoma.  The lens was folded in place into the capsular bag.  Residual Provisc was irrigated from the eye.  The wound was secured with one 10-0 nylon suture.  The lid speculum was removed.  One drop of 5% povidone-iodine prep was placed into the eye as well as a drop of Vigamox and TobraDex ointment.  He had a patch placed on it.  The patient was transported to the recovery room in stable condition.</p>
